 pc_gas_giant:0 "Class J Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Class J planets, also known as Jovian planets, are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen. Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600kph. Many Class J planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice. They form in the cold zone of a star system, though typically much closer than Class I planets."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Class A Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Class A planets are generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Class C world."
 pc_frozen:0 "Class C Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Class K Barren World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Though similar in appearance to Class H worlds, Class K planets lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts. Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, but more complex life never evolves."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Class C Geoinactive World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "When all volcanic activity on a Class A world ceases, the planet is then considered Class C. Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have cold, barren surfaces and no atmosphere. While remaining highly unsuitable for humanoid life, Class C planets are often rich in minerals and suitable for mining."
 pc_desert:0 "Class H Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, arid planets with less than 20% of the surface covered in water, are considered Class H. Though many of these worlds are very hot and sandy, these are not requisite for desert classification. In fact, desert worlds may be both cold and rocky. Though precipitation is rate, drought-resistant planets and animals are common here."
 pc_arid:0 "Class M Arid World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Class M Tundra World"

 pc_alpine:0 "Class M Alpine World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Class M Savanna World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."

 pc_ice_giant:0 "Class I Ice Giant"

 pc_marginal:0 "Class L Warm Super-terrestrial"
 pc_marginal_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds are generally similar to Class M planets, but on a larger scale and with smaller water coverege. The Warm sub-class tends to be rocky and forested, and while they are suitable for life, the scarce water supply makes natural evolution unlikely."

The Cold sub-class tends to be frigid and rocky, with large bodies of frozen water, except in lower latitudes where liquid water and vegetation can be found."
 pc_geometallic:0 "Class F Geometallic"
 pc_geometallic_desc:0 "As a Class E world cools, the crust and core solidify and the planet becomes Class F. These barren worlds are witness to much geologic activity, steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water and forms the first shallow seas, in which bacteria may develop and ultimately thrive. As the core of a Class F planet cools, the volcanic activity lessens and the planet eventually transitions to Class G."
 pc_geocrystalline:0 "Class G Cambrian"
 pc_geocrystalline_desc:0 "After the core of a Class F planet is sufficiently cool, volcanic activity lessens and the planet becomes Class G. Oxygen and Nitrogen are present in some abundance in the atmosphere, giving rise to increasingly complex organisms such as primitive vegetation like algae, and animal akin to sponges and jellyfish. As a Class G planet continues to cool, it can finally transition into the final stage of its evolution." 
 pc_geomorteus:0 "Class B Geomorteus"
 pc_geomorteus_desc:0 "Class B planets are small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, Class B planets have highly unstable molten surfaces. The thin atmospheres are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450º Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200º Celsius at night. No life forms have even been observed on Class B worlds."
 pc_geoplastic:0 "Class E Geoplastic"
 pc_geoplastic_desc:0 "Class E worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a habitable planet. The core and crust are completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and composed of hydrogen and helium. As the planet cools, the core and crust begin to harden and the planet becomes Class F."
 pc_lush:0 "Class M Lush"
 pc_lush_desc:0 "Lush worlds have a temperate climate with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Climate variation is very low, resulting in lush terrain dominating its land masses which are separated by mostly shallow seas. Cold and dry climates are only found near the poles and mountain tops, while deserts are usually non-existent as precepitation levels are similar in every latitude and seasonal variation is minimal. This planet type can be considered perfect for any species that evolved in temperate worlds." 
 pc_retinal:0 "Class M Retinal"
 pc_retinal_desc:0 "Retinal worlds usually have temperate and humid climates, displaying dense vegetation that uses retinal instead of chlorophyll, usually a result of having evolved around a star with low luminosity or as a gas-giant moon. Many Retinal worlds are tidally locked, but increased volcanic activity helps to keep conditions stable due to greenhouse effects." 
 pc_terraformed:0 "Class M Irradiated"
 pc_terraformed_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist."
