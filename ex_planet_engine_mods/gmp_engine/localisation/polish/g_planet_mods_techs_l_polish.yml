 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas:0 "Aero-Chemical Neutralizers"
 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas_desc:0 "It is going to be hard to remove toxic gas clouds that roam the landscape. Our best bet is dropping a mist of chemical neutralizers over them."
 #----- Patch 1.9
 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas_hive_mind:0 "Global Chemical Neutralizers"
 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas_desc_hive_mind:0 "The collective will put it's full effort into spreading chemical neutralizers over these worlds."
 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas_machine_intelligence:0 "Non-Corrosive Alloys"
 tech_gpm_tb_Toxic_Gas_desc_machine_intelligence:0 "By fusing our standard building matterials with a specific non-corrosive element we can keep the toxic gas out of our buildings indefinitally. "

 tech_gpm_tb_Unusual_Formations:0 "Large Scale Demolition"
 tech_gpm_tb_Unusual_Formations_desc:0 "Since these formations are unstable by nature all it would take is some explosives. "
 #----- Patch 1.9
 tech_gpm_tb_Unusual_Formations_machine_intelligence:0 "Systematic Clearing"
 tech_gpm_tb_Unusual_Formations_desc_machine_intelligence:0 "The structural integrity of the terain on this world is highly variable. The terrain will need to be reorganized for more efficient traversing and construction."

 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues:0 "Natural Predators"
 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues_desc:0 "By introducing harmless natural predators into the environment we should be able to control the locus swarms. We are fairly sure nothing can go wrong with this plan."
 #----- Patch 1.9
 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues_hive_mind:0 "Planned Extermination"
 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues_desc_hive_mind:0 "To effectivly combat these swarms we should devide the area in sectors and work from the outside in. Specialised equipment and biological engineered natural predators will be used to systematically eradicate the locust swarms."
 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues_machine_intelligence:0 "Artificial Predators"
 tech_gpm_tb_Locust_Plagues_desc_machine_intelligence:0 "Carefully crafted mechanical insects will be introduced to hunt and kill every single locust."

 tech_gpm_tb_Seasonal_Flooding:0 "Flood Management"
 tech_gpm_tb_Seasonal_Flooding_desc:0 "Flood management strategies generally involve multiple engineering projects that can fall under one of two categories. Hard engineering projects are ones that involve the construction of artificial structures that, through a combination of science, technology and a bit of brute force, prevent a river from flooding. Soft engineering projects are the opposite. These projects use natural resources and local people's knowledge of the river to reduce the risk posed by a flood."
 #----- Patch 1.9
 tech_gpm_tb_Seasonal_Flooding_machine_intelligence:0 "Flood Draining Systems"
 tech_gpm_tb_Seasonal_Flooding_desc_machine_intelligence:0 "Artificial basins and deep underground sisterns will be used to buffer any flood water that appears duo to natural or artificial planetary changes."

 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia:0 "They are no joke!"
 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia_desc:0 "If we could we would take the next shuttle out of here! But sadly we cannot, so we will have to deal with these giant arachnids. Perhaps a giant flamethrower. Something with fire §Ralways§! works."
 #----- Patch 1.9
 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia_hive_mind:0 "Nest Containment"
 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia_desc_hive_mind:0 "A system of containment cells will be contructed around the nests of these arachnics. This will greatly reduce their numbers to a more managable level. The remaining arachnids that exist outside of these cells will be hunted and killed."
 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia_machine_intelligence:0 "Cybernetic Arachnids"
 tech_gpm_tb_Arachnophobia_desc_machine_intelligence:0 "Forcefully implanting mechanical control units will allow us to direct where these arachnids go. We will also be able to kill them on command. A series of drones will be used to entrap, contain and implant these control units into the arachnids' brains. "

 tech_gpm_tb_Dunes:0 "Dune Removal"
 tech_gpm_tb_Dunes_desc:0 "The management of dune removal projects includes planting vegetation successfully. Merely scattering and leaving seeds over sandy areas is perceived as a potential waste as strong winds can blow seeds away. Planting of nurseries should be conducted in the hollows of any present sand hills or in depressions of sandy areas. Seeds should be planted in moist conditions and should be lightly covered by a layer of sand and large mature grass individuals should be planted in deep holes with the tops of the plants cut short so as to reduce wind resistance."
