 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hw_pharaonic_desc:0 "Their homeworld an industrial wasteland, after generations of exploitation and rampant pollution, the Pharaonic Malignity are now looking for other worlds to colonise, or conquer.\n\nTheir homeworld is nearly depleted of coal, oil and gas and their atmosphere is all but destroyed. This is the way of things and they will find new worlds to consume. If the new worlds are already colonised they will lose themselves into the sea of people and infiltrate the worlds elite. When they have the power to rule they will oppress the people and send their mighty fleets to subjugate them, lost and without hope.\n\nThey are an ancient people, productively and economically astute. They channel their output towards military production and can tender large fleets. Before using their fleets, however, they will employ tactics of influence and diplomacy to acquire their goals."
