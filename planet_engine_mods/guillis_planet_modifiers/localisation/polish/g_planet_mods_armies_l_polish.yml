 gpm_precursor_mech_army:0 "Salvaged Precursor Mech"
 gpm_precursor_mech_army_desc:0 "Salvaged Precursor Mech. It cost a lot of resources but we've finally managed to get one working! Towering far above the colony, with massive on-board weaponry these mechs are a sight to behold. The enormity of this machine means we can only use it for defensive purposes, unfortunately."

 gpm_precursor_bunker_army_desc:0 "Salvaged Precursor Bunker. The complexity of the bunker grid on this world is amazing. Clearly designed by an advanced AI. It seems every bunker is a self-maintaining system, one which we can use to our advantage. Virtually impenetrable walls mean it'll take our enemies months to get through. With enough of these bunkers we might just be able to hold off hostile forces indefinitely."

 # 3 army
 gpm_giant_arachnid_army:0 "Giant Arachnid Army"
 gpm_giant_arachnid_army_desc:0 "Trough blood, sweat and tears.. well mostly blood and tears, we have managed to tame the arachnids! A cybernetic implant lets us control these giant arachnids by suggestion a direction for them to move to. They usually proceed to try and eat anything they encounter. Dropping the arachnids from orbit might just be scary enough to win the war!"

 gpm_precursor_mech_army_machine_desc:0 "Repurposed Precursor Mech. Using these mechs as a base, we have integrated a substantial amounts of our own systems. Artificial joints and muscles were used to force movement where needed. Additionally, a new power source and a control unit were all it took to get these mechs to function again. "

It seems every bunker is a self-maintaining system, one which we can use to our advantage. Virtually impenetrable walls mean it'll take our enemies months to get through. With enough of these bunkers we might just be able to hold off hostile forces indefinitely. By introducing self-sufficient sentinal drone swarms we can ensure every bunker in the grid can eliminate any potential intruder."

 gpm_giant_arachnid_army_machine:0 "Cybernetic Arachnid Swarms"
 gpm_giant_arachnid_army_machine_desc:0 "Using extensive cybernetics and deep-brain-implants on these arachnids we have manage to obtain complete control of these violent creatures. Fast breeding programs ensure a large supply of these creatures can be used. Programmed to behave like a tight, fast moving swarm they will ensure victory over our enemies in virtually any type of situation."
