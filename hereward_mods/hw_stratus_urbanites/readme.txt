HW: Species - Stratus Urbanites

Version: 1.3

The Stratus Urbanites are a peaceful race relying on tourism and trade. They
have developed interesting techniques in the construction of their cities and
orbital trading facilities.

They live on a savannah world with twin moons. Their homeworld draws tourist
from afar to view their amazing cities and by night the skies are laden with
the romantic views of twin moons.

* Collection of Cities


A long time ago in a game far, far away....
This is a reworking of a species from a pack I originally developed for
Galactic Civilizations (which only works in Windows). Having converted to Linux
I am so pleased to discover Stellaris.

* Naeb Aggregation - A peaceful aquatic race driven by the necessity to adapt
and colonise other worlds as their aged homeworld slowly cools and freezes.

* Pharaonic Malignity - Having heavily polluted their homeworld with the
consumption of hydrocarbon fuels the Pharaonic Malignity are now looking for
other worlds to colonise, or conquer.

* Rwaddi Shrewdness - The Rwaddi are a race of arboreal primates who are more
at home on their jungle world than they are at spacefaring.

* Stratus Urbanites - The Stratus live on a savannah world with twin moons.
Their homeworld draws tourist from afar to view their amazing cities and the
romantic views of moons.


Enjoy,

Hereward
