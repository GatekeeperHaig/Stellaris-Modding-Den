 # Star localizations
 
 pc_b_star:0 "Blue Giant"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_a_star:0 "White Star"
 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_f_star:0 "White Dwarf"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star. A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool."
 pc_g_star:0 "Yellow Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, K, G and F type stars actually range in color from white to slightly orange. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than Red stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a yellow star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Red Supergiant"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "Stars of spectral type K or M. These are the largest stars in the universe in terms of volume, although they are not the most massive or luminous."
 pc_m_star:0 "Red Dwarf"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_t_star:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 pc_t_star_desc:0 "Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life."
 pc_m_giant_star:0 "Red Giant"
 pc_m_giant_star_desc:0 "With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits."
