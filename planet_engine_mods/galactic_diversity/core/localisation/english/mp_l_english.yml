 ###Stars
 pc_d_star:0 "White Dwarf"
 pc_d_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star. A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool." 
 
 ###Habitable Query

 mpengine.01.desc:0 "§WAs we reach for the stars, we need to set expectations regarding the chances of finding worlds capable of supporting life. How common do you believe habitable worlds are?\n\n§GWhatever:§! Stay silent.\n\n§GVery High:§! I would be very disappointed if on average we don't find one habitable planet for each star in the galaxy.\n\n§GHigh:§! I'm sure there must be many star systems with at least one habitable world.\n\n§GLow:§! I'm expecting it will take some effort to find them, but it is a big galaxy.\n\n§GVery Low:§! We should consider ourselves lucky to find rocks we can mine for resources, the day we find another livable world will become a new universal holyday."

 ###Decisions
