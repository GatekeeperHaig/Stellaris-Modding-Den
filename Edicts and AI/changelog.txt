[h1]Planetary Edicts Rebalanced/Reworked[/h1]

[u][b]Regular Edicts, costing 50 influence and lasting 10 years:[b][/u]
I removed the restrictions of using almost all of these edicts as gestalt consciousness empires. To that effect I renamed them and rewrote their descriptions as necessary. 

[u]Capacity Overload:[/u] renamed Energy Production Focus. Bonus increased to +20% energy production (was 15%). Unlocks through the tech "Colonial Beureaucracy" (t1/4).

[u]Farming Subsidies:[/u] renamed Agricultural Production Focus. Bonus unchanged (+25% food production). Unlocks through the tech "Colonial Beureaucracy" (t1/4).

[u]Propaganda Broadcasts:[/u] renamed Integration Focus. Bonus replaced (was +10% happiness) with +20% unity production. Unlocks through the tech "Colonial Beureaucracy" (t1/4).

[u]Land of Opportunity:[/u] renamed Migration Focus. Increased the migration bonus to 150% (was 100%). Unlocks through the tech "Colonial Beureaucracy" (t1/4).  This edict is not available to gestalt consciousness empires.  

[u]Infrastructure Projects:[/u] renamed Infrastructure Focus. Increased the planet build speed bonus to +50% (was +33%). No tech unlock (available at game start).

[u]Reeducation Campaigns:[/u] renamed Social Engineering Focus. Ethic Attraction bonus increased to +75% (was +50%). Unlocks through the tech "Planetary Unification" (t1/1). This edict is not available to gestalt consciousness empires.  

[u]Patrol Drones:[/u] renamed Peacekeeping Focus. Removed the machine empire only restriction. Bonus is the same (-50% unrest). Unlocks through the tech "Galactic Ambitions" (t1/4).

[u][b]New Regular Edicts[/b][/u]

[u]Scientific Focus:[/u] +15% research tile production bonus. Unlocked through the tech "Colonial Beureaucracy" (t1/4).

[u]Fortification Focus:[/u] gives +100% planetary fortification strength, +100% pop fortification bonus and +100% garrison health. Unlocks with tech "Centralized Command" (t1/1)

[u]Army Buildup Focus:[/u] gives +50% army build speed and -25% army build cost. Unlocks with the tech "Combat Training" (t1/4)

[u]Spaceport Focus:[/u] -25% spaceport build cost, -25% spaceport module build cost, -50% spaceport upkeep. Unlocks with the tech "Spaceport 2" (t1/3)

[u][b]Ethic Unique Edicts, costing 100 influence and lasting 25 years:[b][/u]
I removed the restrictions of using regular edicts when having a fanatic ethic. Players will now have a choice between a cheaper edict with less effects, and a more expensive - ethic unique edict. I also changed the special edicts from being those of fanatic ethics only to being unlocked with regular ethics. Thus a player can potentially have up to 3 ethic specific edicts unlocked at one time. I decided to make it so all ethic specific edicts should be tech unlocked from the technology Galactic Bureaucracy (t2/3).

[u]Social Engineering:[/u] renamed Reeducation Campaigns. Must be some degree of authoritarian to use. Gives +100% governing ethic attraction and an extra +50% authoritarian ethic attraction. 

[u]Grassroots Administration:[/u] renamed Intersectional Taxation. Must be some degree of egalitarian to use. Gives +25% tile energy production and -10% pop consumer goods cost. 

[u]Peace Festival:[/u] renamed Prosperity Endowments. Must be some degree of pacifist to use. Gives +25% growth and +5% pop happiness. 

[u]Arms Race:[/u] must be some degree of militarist to use. Gives +25% ship build speed and -10% ship build cost. 

[u]Legal Aliens:[/u] renamed Land of Opportunity. Must be some degree of xenophile to use. Gives +400% xeno migration attraction. 

[u]Purity Laws:[/u] must be some degree of xenophobe to use. Gives +10% tile unity production and +75% xenophobe ethic attracton. 

[u]Religious Unity:[/u] renamed Consecrated World. Must be some degree of spiritualist to use. Gives +30% tile unity production. 

[u]Spirit of Science:[/u] renamed Robotic Modernization. Must be some degree of materialist to use. Gives +25% robot build speed and -15% robot build cost.  

[u][b]Advanced Edicts, costing 150 unity and lasting 50 years:[b][/u]

In vanilla there is only the Consecrated Worlds edict that unlocks with an Ascension Perk. I find this edict to be extremely problematic, since it is spiritualist exclusive and includes an integral spiritualist bias. I therefore decided to rework the vanilla Ascension Perk and edict in the following way:

I renamed Consecrated Worlds into Imperial Fulcrum and rewrote the description. This Ascension Perk can be unlocked by ALL empires but picking it unlocks a different edict depending on the player's respective empire type:

[u]Imperial Fulcrum for Organic Empires:[/u] +10% pop happiness, +25% governing ethics attraction, +25% growth speed, +5% pop production

[u]Imperial Fulcrum for Hive-Mind Empires:[/u] +50% pop growth, +10% pop production, -20% consumer goods cost.  

[u]Imperial Fulcrum for Machine Empires:[/u] +50% robot build speed, -25% robot build cost, +10% robot output. 

[u]Imperial Fulcrum for Synth Empires:[/u] +50% robot build speed, -25% robot build cost, +10% pop happiness, +25% governing ethics attraction.
