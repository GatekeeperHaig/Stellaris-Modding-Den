## TERRESTRIAL classes are prime habitable worlds characterized by having multiple continents separated by oceans, leading to increased geo and biological diversity.

## Pangaian Class - Can also be classified as Oceanic, as it has a large landmass surrounded by a world-wide ocean. With time, this landmass is likely to split into several continents, much like Earth did earlier in its geological history.
