 crucible_homeplanet:0 "Trapped Like Rats"
 crucible_homeplanet_desc:0 "The shield blocks most scanning of this world. However, small frequency fluctuations allow us to observe the post-apocalyptic state of the planet with entrapped tribes waging war over scarce resources."
 crucible_military_moon:0 "Defence Luna"
 crucible_military_moon_desc:0 "This Luna is all the remains of a sophisticated defence system destroyed by a giant mass accelerator."
 crucible_shieldedplanet:0 "Sparks Below"
 crucible_shieldedplanet_desc:0 "While the shield here is still operational, scans show that it is slowly losing cohesion and will likely dissipate within a thousand years."
 pdcrucible.10.name:0 "Ancient Battleground"
 pdcrucible.10.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName] entered the system they were greeted by a cloud of what appears to be the wreckage of hundreds of warships. [Root.GetLeaderName] will carefully examine the debris to determine the source and cause of the carnage. ."
 pdcrucible.10.a:0 "Be wary for traps."
 pdcrucible.20.name:0 "Sparks Below"
 pdcrucible.20.desc:0 "It appears that this system was once home to a militaristic spacefaring race. Their homeworld and first Luna are encased in powerful planetary shields. Orbital debris shows evidence of a second Luna seemingly destroyed by a large mass accelerator."
 pdcrucible.20.a:0 "Interesting."
 pdcrucible.50.name:0 "Sparks Below"
 pdcrucible.50.desc:0 "Sifting through the black boxes and computer fragments in the debris we have figured out that this was the final battle between a local polity known as the Rusnad Empire and a rebel coalition of aliens they had enslaved known as the United Liberation Alliance.\n\n Decrypted information from Rusnad ships notes reference a shortage of a powerful fuel that they used with their forges which led to declines in their ability to maintain their fleet over time. The rebellion of the United Liberation Alliance seized this opportunity, progressing slowly over several decades until finally pushing into the Rusnad core systems where the former masters were ultimately defeated."
 pdcrucible.50.a:0 "Excellent"
 pdcrucible.51.desc:0 "One of the Rusnad's tactical advantages appears to have been their second Luna which housed a sophisticated planetary defence system. In response, the Alliance developed the largest mass accelerator the galaxy had ever seen, little more than un/a enormous gun with un/a engine strapped on the back. When the Alliance entered the system they fired, and while the slug took several days to reach its target the Rusnad were helpless to stop it. The debris from the shattered world are visible from orbit. "
 pdcrucible.51.a:0 "Interesting"
 pdcrucible.52.desc:0 "After the defeat over their homeworld, Rusaria was encased by the Alliance. Alliance communications show that they thought trapping the Rusnad to fight amongst themselves was a fitting end to their empire. They wanted to put them into a squalor similar to what they had experienced at their old master's hands."
 pdcrucible.52.a:0 "Amazing"
 pdcrucible.53.desc:0 "After encasing the Rusnad homeworld, the Alliance took months to repeat the process on Rusaria's remaining Luna, the main Rusnad industrial base known as The Crucible. Alliance communication claimed it had the ability to produce high amounts of quality alloys in a short time. Eventually, the group supporting encasing won out and it suffered the same fate as the homeworld."
 pdcrucible.53.a:0 "Understood"
 pdcrucible.54.desc:0 "After some deeper scans it appears that the shield around the Crucible is in fact failing, but should last for at least another thousand years. This process could be sped up with our current understanding of shields, but doing so on a planetary scale would take time and effort."
 pdcrucible_site:0 "Sparks Below"
 pdcrucible_site_desc:0 "The ones responsible for shielding these worlds clearly saw this system as a threat. Between the graveyard of ships scattered around the system and these shielded planets, our researcher have much to learn here."

 origin_crucible_world:0 "From The Ashes of the Rusnads"
 origin_crucible_world_desc:0 "This civilization is the remnants of un/a ancient empire that was defeated by its enemies who encased their homeworld and first Luna behind a massive planetary shield. Following their imprisonment, they spent centuries in vicious tribal warfare over their homeworld's depleted resources. Finally they have come together and destroyed the shield trapping them. Newly free, they have set their sights on their Luna, a forge world with the power to fuel their rekindled galactic ambitions."

 pd_origin_init_crucible_NAME:0 "Crucible System"
 pd_origin_init_crucible_DESC:0 "A starting system containing The Crucible under a planetary shield."
 START_SCREEN_CRUCIBLE_ORIGIN:0 "Our elders speak of a time when our empire spanned the stars and we lorded over many species. But that at our height our greed led to a shortage of the divine fuel source, thus allowing our slaves to rise against us. In our defeat they used our own technology to encase our homeworld in un/a impenetrable shield. Since then we've known almost constant warfare between tribes, losing much of our advanced knowledge in the process \n\nRecently we came together and set aside our differences to destroy the shield around our home. It took generations but at last we have torn down the walls holding us. \n\nNow we must figure out how to break the shield over our first Luna, which our legends claim contains a powerful forge that we may harness to reclaim our lost glory.. Will we learn from the mistakes of our ancestors and build a new, more just society, or use our regained might to wreak revenge against a galaxy that wronged us?"
 d_sizable_ruins:0 "Sizable Ruins"
 d_sizable_ruins_desc:0 "Generations of infighting have laid waste to our once vast cities. Clearing it away will allow the area to be used again and unearth valuable relics of our past."
