 ###Planet Query

 atw_engine.99.desc:0 "§WAs we reach for the stars, we need to set expectations regarding the chances of finding planets orbiting other stars. How common do you believe these worlds to be?\n\n§GVery High:§! Systems with around 10 planets and twice as many moons should be very common.\n\n§GHigh:§! I'm expecting to find both systems with plenty of planets and moons, and others with only a few of them.\n\n§GLow:§! I'm sure we may find some systems like our own, but most are likely smaller.\n\n§GVery Low:§! We should consider ourselves lucky to have these many planets on our own system, I seriously doubt we ever find more than a handfull around another star.\n\n§GNo answer:§! I wish I knew..."
