 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Class J planets, also known as Jovian planets, are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen. Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600kph. Many Class J planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice. They form in the cold zone of a star system, though typically much closer than Class I planets."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Geothermal World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Class A planets are generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Class C world."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Though similar in appearance to Class H worlds, Class K planets lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts. Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, but more complex life never evolves."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Geoinactive World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "When all volcanic activity on a Class A world ceases, the planet is then considered Class C. Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have cold, barren surfaces and no atmosphere. While remaining highly unsuitable for humanoid life, Class C planets are often rich in minerals and suitable for mining."
 pc_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, arid planets with less than 20% of the surface covered in water, are considered Class H. Though many of these worlds are very hot and sandy, these are not requisite for desert classification. In fact, desert worlds may be both cold and rocky. Though precipitation is rate, drought-resistant planets and animals are common here."
 pc_arid:0 "Arid World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Steppes World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_continental:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_ocean:0 "Pelagic World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "Any planet with more than 80% of the surface covered in liquid water is considered Class O. There worlds are usually very warm and possess vast cetacean popylations in addition to tropical vegetation and animal life."
 pc_arctic:0 "Glaciated World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_alpine:0 "Alpine World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Savanna World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
 pc_toxic:0 "Toxic World"
 pc_toxic_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 pc_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere that may have had a different class in its recent past. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life."

 pc_continental_tile:0 "Temperate Terrain"
 pc_continental_tile_desc:0 "Diverse forested terrain with a mild climate."
 pc_terraformed_tile:0 "Temperate Terrain"
 pc_terraformed_tile_desc:0 "Diverse forested terrain with a mild climate."
 pc_desert_tile:0 "Desert Terrain"
 pc_desert_tile_desc:0 "Barren and dry terrain with occasional rocky outcroppings."
 pc_arid_tile:0 "Arid Terrain"
 pc_arid_tile_desc:0 "Dry and rocky terrain with sparse vegetation."
 pc_tundra_tile:0 "Steppes Terrain"
 pc_tundra_tile_desc:0 "Cold and wind-swept steppes with sparse vegetation."
 pc_tropical_tile:0 "Tropical Terrain"
 pc_tropical_tile_desc:0 "Vegetation-covered terrain with a warm and humid climate."
 pc_ocean_tile:0 "Ocean Terrain"
 pc_ocean_tile_desc:0 "Isolated islands and archipelagos surrounded by ocean."
 pc_arctic_tile:0 "Arctic Terrain"
 pc_arctic_tile_desc:0 "Snow and ice-covered terrain with no vegetation."
 pc_savannah_tile:0 "Savanna Terrain"
 pc_savannah_tile_desc:0 "Warm, dry terrain with widely spaced trees and shrubs."
 pc_alpine_tile:0 "Alpine Terrain"
 pc_alpine_tile_desc:0 "Elevated terrain covered in snow and ice."
