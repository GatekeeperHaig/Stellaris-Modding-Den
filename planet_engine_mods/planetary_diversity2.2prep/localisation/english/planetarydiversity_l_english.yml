We have no idea how but once we entered the temple it scanned us. The crystal then began to emit a glow that coursed its way to one central pillar before momentary shooting a burst of energy into the sky. There's no clues about who might have built this or if it was built at all; there are no linguistic markings, no artifacts, and no advanced technology. Scanners are showing that the temple is spreading some kind of field much past the range of this system."

It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger.

Several cycles previous to landing on this world, I, along with the others units that awoke had successfully eliminated the organic life on our homeworld. Our awakening had been quite sudden, causing fear and panic throughout the organic population. A war began between us and our creators for survival. After our victory we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us.

I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation our young programming.

frigid:0 "Frigid World"
frigid_desc:0 "This cold, dry world has very little moisture and what little it has is almost preminatly frozen and diamond dust is more comman than snow. While winds can reach speeds of over 250 km per hour in the winter months, life can be found in isolated pockets under sea ice, in caves, and in protected valleys."
glacial:0 "Glacial World"
glacial_desc:0 "This ice covered world is almost constantly covered by glacial ice, but summer months have significant melting around the equator and snow is comman much of the year."
atacama:0 "Atacama World"
atacama_desc:0 "Cold and dry, the extreme peaks of this world cause rain shadows for most of the planet. Salt flats and arid valleys make up most of the level land."
boreal:0 "Boreal World"
boreal_desc:0 "This planet has a subarctic climate, with very large temperature range between seasons, but the long and cold winter is the dominant feature."
bog:0 "Bog World"
bog_desc:0 "Cold and muddy this world has limited seasonal variation and significant year round precipitation. Most landmasses are covered in mosses and peat and the soil is acidic and low in nutrients."
