[h1]6 Unique Strategic Resources and special empire unique buildings to exploit them[/h1]
This mod adds 6 unique Strategic Resources - resources that spawn on a maximum of 1 planet per galaxy (not guranteed to have 100% spawn of all resources if galaxy is medium or below). 

-This mod is 100% savegame compatible: the mod runs an event that adds the deposits to planets, so you can use it in the middle of a savegame or in a new game. It is also 100% compatible with all other mods out there since it does not overwrite any vanilla files. 
-I would like to thank @Elowiny, who contribued most of the building assets and 1 of the resource icons used by this mod (and 2 resource names). 
-This mod synergizes with ExOverhaul: Strategic Resources, but that mod is not required for this mod to work.
