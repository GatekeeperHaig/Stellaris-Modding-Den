 gpm_colony.3.desc:0 "Our initial scans of this world showed a lot of metal from the crashed ships. There must be hundreds spread out over this world. Unfortunately, due to the many alloys and busted electronics of these colossal crashed ships our scans were subjected to heavy electromagnetic interference and thus were unable to give a detailed reading of every wreck.\nNow that we have started doing visual inspections we have discovered something amazing. A few of the ships down there are still emitting EM-radiation, meaning there is still power left in them. Perhaps their databanks can teach us something about their designs, or their makers."

 gpm_colony.4.desc:0 "Our initial goal of accessing their databanks wasn't quite a success, we've discovered that these ships belonged to two different warring factions. One highly advanced and the other, less so.. Sadly not much was able to be gained from their databases; it seems to have been standard procedure to wipe them if the ship became unusable.\nDuring our salvaging we did stumbled upon another ship wreck. This one is far far more complete. Our engineers have proposed to try and repair it with parts from a nearby wreck. Perhaps even use it as a template to try and salvage a few more nearby ships that don't look too terrible damaged."

This wreck is 78.318% complete and structural integrity is good enough to begin intensive scanning and cataloguing procedures.

It was covered by dust and other wreckage that fell from a massive space battle that took place overhead millennia ago.\nIt was good that we took a closer look. The shiny hull that was showing isn't just a small crashed ship; it was just a single section of a much larger ship. A ship that was surprisingly still in one piece. After digging it out we discovered the reason it failed was a direct hit to its control center which threw it spiralling down into the planet.\nAfter gathering parts from nearby ships we were able to construct a control center in the ship entirely to our own specifications. After powering up the ship we were surprised how easily it's integrated AI was able to translate and support our own systems. It only took a few days for our instruments to control the ship. After a few more tests we are ready to fly it into orbit, into service."
