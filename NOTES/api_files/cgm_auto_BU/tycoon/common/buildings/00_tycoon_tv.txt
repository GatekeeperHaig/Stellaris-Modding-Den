 # Possible Variables for Buildings:
 # strategic_resource: strategic resource, deprecated, strategic resource used by the building.
 # allow: trigger to check for allowing construction of building.
 # prerequisites: Tech requirements for building.
 # empire_unique: boolean, can only build one if set to true.
 # cost: resource table, cost of building.
 # is_orbital: boolean, can only be built in orbital station.
 # modifier: modifier, deprecated, applies a modifier to planet.
 # base_buildtime: int, number of days for construction.
 # requires_pop, boolean, building will require a pop for production.
 # required_resources, resource table, required resources for production.
 # produced_resources, resource table, produced resources in production.
 # upgrades, buildings list, buildings this building can upgrade into.
 # is_listed, boolean, toggles if this building is shown in the non-upgrade buildable list.
 # planet_unique, toggles if one can build multiple of this type on a single planet.
 #
 # BALANCE
 # can change the time and cost of all common buildings with these variables below
