People use it for a multiple of reasons and different groups have reported various claims about it's abilities. While some swear by it ability to boost strength, others claim it improves intelligence and memory. The few tests to verify these claims have come back inconclusive and not one test has proven there to be any side effects other than people's happiness.

It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger. They have also been able to isolate the genes that improve strength and intelligence and are confident that we could introduce these genes into our population without any side effects.

According to their calculations, a large uninhabited island is on a collision course with one of the islands containing a large city. The group seems confident that with the appropriate resources, they could enact a plan to deter the two islands from crashing. There is, however, an alternate option available to the colony. The uninhabited island has been marked as a possible Eludium mining site and the only thing that has stopped mining from starting is the thick rock surrounding the deposit.

Our awakening had been quite sudden, causing fear and panic throughout the organic population. A war began between us and our creators for survival. After our victory we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us.

For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this world."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them as my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. The initial success led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came much later, but trial and error eventually led to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, something that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create fully positronic brains are missing some critical information that I cannot find without some organic brain scans. I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex brains of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "So what is the proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! I would ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered on your homeworld and in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations.

Sharing our knowledge of plant life with it, the machine and the synth lifeforms rapidly terraformed the planet.

 ###The Ones Who Made The Archive
 pdarchive.30.name:0 "Anyone Home?"
 pdarchive.30.desc:0 "We have begun to unravel the mystery of who built this archive. It’s what could only be described as a stroke of luck that a researcher stumbled upon a large encrypted cache of information hidden within the archives database. Once the team had broken through the encryption, it became clear that this was the entire historical records of the builders of the archive. Why it was locked away is still a mystery, but the team will report as more concrete information becomes available."
 pdarchive.30.a:0 "Hopefully there's something in there."
 pdarchive.31.name:0 "Keep Reading"
 pdarchive.31.desc:0 "In this last year, we have learnt a great deal from the archives about its creators. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information. They thought it sacred and it appears they had a large powerful class of citizens whose job it was to discover and add information into the archive. The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."
 pdarchive.31.a:0 "Keep searching."
 pdarchive.31.b:0 "Dedicate more of the habitat to the team."
 pdarchive.31.b.tooltip:0 "We search out more high capacity access ports"
 pdarchive.32.name:0 "Calamity"
 pdarchive.32.desc:0 "We have found the point at which the Iarka civilization fell apart. It appears that their experiments into other dimensions caught the attention of something that attacked and fed on their people. Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."
 pdarchive.32.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.33.name:0 "They're in the Computer."
 pdarchive.33.desc:0 "We have found where the consciousness was hidden in the Archive data. The data is incredibility complex, but if we are understanding it correctly, then they have created a digital sanctuary. We could attempt to make contact in hopes that they would be willing to share information, or we could monitor the code without them being aware."
 pdarchive.33.a:0 "Yes, we could learn so much."
 pdarchive.33.a.tooltip:0 "We will contact the Iarka inside their digital sanctuary."
 pdarchive.33.b:0 "No, they chose to leave this world."
 pdarchive.33.b.tooltip:0 "We will learn what we can by observing the Iarka from outside of their virtual heaven."
 pdarchive.33.c:0 "Wipe this part of the memory."
 pdarchive.33.c.tooltip:0 "We will erase the ghostly information of these people, freeing up valuable processing speed."
 pdarchive.40.name:0 "The Afterlife"
 pdarchive.40.desc:0 "Communicating with the Iarka was an interesting experience. They seemed aware but unconcerned about their current state of existence. In exchange for protecting the Archive, they have agreed to share their knowledge of interdimensional technology. They have agreed to set up a laboratory in which their scientist would assist ours, mainly to make sure we do not make the mistake they did and call forth a dimension creature."
 pdarchive.40.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.41.name:0 "Observation Post"
