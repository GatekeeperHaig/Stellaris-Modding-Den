####Planetary Diversity Localisations

 #planet classes
 pc_cascadian:0 "Cascadian World"
 pc_cascadian_desc:0 "Sub-temperate mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere consisting of boreal forests and towering mountain ranges.  An active, stormy, hydrosphere with strong differences between snowy winters and short warmer summers."
 pc_swamp:0 "Swamp World"
 pc_swamp_desc:0 "Cold, muddy world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasonal variation is limited with significant precipitation. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_oasis:0 "Oasis World"
 pc_oasis_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Hydrosphere only supports one large body of water which has a band vegetation around it.  Rain barely reaches the inland desert that covers the majority of the planet."
 pc_steppe:0 "Steppe World"
 pc_steppe_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Low amounts of precipitation and cold temperatures keep the planet in a thin layer of snow most of the year. The landscape is covered in grass and shrubs during the short summer months."
 pc_frozen_desert:0 "Katpana World"
 pc_frozen_desert_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation is low and major bodies of surface water are rare."
 pc_mesa:0 "Mesa World"
 pc_mesa_desc:0 "Hot, dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Great plateaus and mesas are common around the equator, with cooler forested polar regions.  Hydrosphere is mostly in large rivers that have cut canyons with vegetation covering riverbeds."
 pc_hadesert:0 "Atacama World"
 pc_hadesert_desc:0 "Cold, dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Extreme altitude peaks cause rain shadows for most of the planet, and salt flats and arid valley make up most of the level land. Hydrosphere is in a few lakes and mountain springs."
 pc_geothermal:0 "Geothermal World"
 pc_geothermal_desc:0 "Cold, icy planet with tropical rifts that break up the expanses of ice, heated by natural geothermal vents with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Hydrosphere is in melt water and steams rising from vents."
 pc_desertislands:0 "Atoll World"
 pc_desertislands_desc:0 "An ocean planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Shallow lagoons, coral reefs and tropical islands make up the majority of this planet, with warm temperatures supporting a very large biosphere." 
 pc_sandsea:0 "Dune World"
 pc_sandsea_desc:0 "A hot and dry rocky planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seas of sand dunes cover a considerable portion of the surface.  Hydrosphere is mainly in underground aquifers that rise up in oasis and mountain springs."
 pc_mangrove:0 "Mangrove World"
 pc_mangrove_desc:0 "A humid wet world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Most of the planet is covered in shallow seas with very little land above sea level.  Jungles extended for hundreds of miles beyond the shores of the few existing islands.  Hydrosphere is strong and stable, and supports a great abundance of planet and animal life." 
 pc_glacial:0 "Glacial World"
 pc_glacial_desc:0 "Frigid, icy world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice all over the surface of the planet, with very little melting over the summer months.  Geothermal activity creates supports an abundance of marine life under the thick surface ice."
 pc_subarctic:0 "Crag World"
 pc_subarctic_desc:0 "Cold, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans and polar ice caps cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with rugged scattered islands dotting its surface.  There is an abundance of volcanic and geothermal activity which supports marine ecosystems."
 pc_hajungle:0 "Tepui World"
 pc_hajungle_desc:0 "Mountainous, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Hydrosphere is mostly in low altitude seas, which cause considerable fog and cloud cover.  In the higher altitudes, standing water is rare and most plant life relies on the mist and fog."
 pc_antarctic:0 "Antarctic World"
 pc_antarctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Hydrosphere is mostly frozen, with diamond dust being as common as snow.  While winds can reach speeds of over 250 km per hour in the winter months, life can be found in isolated pockets under sea ice, in caves, and in protected valleys."
 pc_tidallylocked:0 "Tidally-Locked World"
 pc_tidallylocked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  With the planet tidally locked to its sun, one side of the planet is in constant daylight, while the other is in constant night.   A thin habitable zone exists in the twilight region.  Constant sunlight and wind make for ideal food and energy generation." 
 pc_methane:0 "Methane World"
 pc_methane_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-methane atmosphere and this planet's variable gas is methane.  With temperatures, around -180 degrees Celsius the methane hydrosphere is stable."
 pc_ammonia:0 "Ammonia World"
 pc_ammonia_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-ammonia atmosphere. This planet's variable gas is ammonia.  With temperatures around -100 degrees Celsius, the ammonia hydrosphere is stable."
 pc_hothouse:0 "Hothouse World"
 pc_hothouse_desc:0 "A rocky world with an atmosphere currently experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect.  Lethal to all forms of life."   
 #floating world
 pc_floating:0 "Floating World"
 pc_floating_desc:0 "A strange world of floating islands with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Islands seem to hang steady in the sky above a world of endless ocean.  Thick vegetation and many flying creatures inhabit this world."
 #crystal world
 pc_crystal:0 "Crystal World"
 pc_crystal_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Immense crystal deposits can be found all over the surface, especially in the tropical regions.  Animal and plant life seem to be thriving on this planet."
