# Changed minimun habitability to 20%, so marginal planets can only be colonized after habitability improving techs have been researched
# Also added the possibility of terraforming marginals to the same class, gaining a habitability bonus modifier
# Species with Adaptable trait can colonize Marginals after terraforming them to the same class (10% bonus from trait + 10% bonus from terraformed modifier)
