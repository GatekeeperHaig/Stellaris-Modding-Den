They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information.

The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."

Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."

Hoping to end the dimensional experiments, an anti-gate group destroyed the control mechanism of a stable gateway. While the ability to control the gate was lost, the wormhole was too established and stayed open. The gravimetric activity of this uncontrolled wormhole caused earthquakes and a large amount of environmental damage to the planet. After weeks of attempts to close them, the unimaginable happened; towering inter-dimensional creatures came through the portal and attacked the planet. The Iarkans defenses had little effect on these creatures and as many Iarkans escaped to the Archive. We have almost unlocked the final part of the information and will report then."

With the Archive Habitat unable to produce enough food to sustain the survivors it was decided that they would digitize their memories and consciousness into the Archive . They scrubbed every bit of info on the gates away and encrypted their history behind them. This last level of encryption also alerted us to the location of their memory core where their people and knowledge is stored.

It's plating is able to give off powerful electric fields and while it's presence has a stabilizing effect on the planetary ecosystem, it can also manipulate these same planetary forces as a means of self-defense. It's likely that our weather arrays were interfering with, or damaging, the creature's natural ecosystem, causing it to suddenly attack. Additionally, our biologists seem to think killing these beasts off could lead to environmental damage. Second, the territory the Progenitor patrols is rich in strategic resources, but it's clear that any mining project would be at grave danger to attacks from the creature.\n\nAside from slight changes to the array, which we can confirm will no longer provoke the beast, we are at an impasse on how to proceed. One option is developing stealth technology to create limited research zones inside the levithan's territory, while the other favours developing repulsor technology to drive it from the rich resources."

 pdcoral.12.name:0 "Fire In The Sky"
 pdcoral.12.desc:0 "The science team's theory is that a supernova from a nearby star system swept across the planet and devastated most of the ecosystem. While not enough to immediately destroy all life on the planet, the radiation burst seems to have evaporated much of the planet's water and destabilized the it's magnetosphere, allowing much of the world's water to be lost to solar winds. The mass excision event reduced biodiversity to roughly a fifth of it's previous levels, with remaining wildlife concentrating around the surviving coral reefs. Despite this, the slow bleed off of atmosphere should have doomed the planet within several centuries; some other work is at play here. The team has located another geological site at the bottom of a meteor impact site that they hope will shed new information."

"
 pdcoral.13.a:0 "Great Work."
 pdcoral.14.name:0 " Planetary Adaptation"
 pdcoral.14.desc:0 "After examining more recent fossil records, [Root.GetLeaderName] has begun creating a timeline of ecological change after the two climate-altering events. While the meteor helped re-establish the magnetosphere, it also wreaked havoc on the little remaining ecology. Much of the land biodiversity died off in the following years, and environmental contamination gradually turned the oceans into the salty, toxic state we find it in today. For the majority of the planetary ice age, life clung deep at the bottom of the oceans, and in the isolated coral reefs closer to the surface. As the planet slowly began to stabilize, the remaining coral growths had developed incredible resistance to environmental damage and began to dominate the shallows of all remaining bodies of water, and eventually even adapting onto the shore and beyond.\n\nThe study of these geological events has given us an extremely rich and detailed history of this world, and given insight on how we could adapt animal and plant life to other worlds."

The last of our survivors, who were already struggling around the equator, realized their only hope was to reach for the stars.\n\nToday, warmth is a luxury. Our people struggle against the cold, whether by the freezing winds of our homeworld, or the vacuum of space in the orbital habitat built most of us now call home.\n\nWith resource stockpiles nearing depletion, our scientists have finally discovered the secrets of hyperdrive technology.

 #Biolumen Event Update 
 pdbiolumen.30.name:0 "The Jungle Came Alive and Took Them"
 pdbiolumen.30.desc:0 "There have been several gruesome murders on [Root.Planet.GetName]. Usually while alone, individuals have gone missing and the few bodies that have been recovered are found impaled amount the trees with organs removed. We believe some kind of wild animal is to blame, but this gruesome behaviour has caused sensational fear throughout the colony about monsters in the woods."
 pdbiolumen.30.a:0 "Monitor the situation."
 pdbiolumen.30.b:0 "We're above this superstitious nonsense."
 pdbiolumen.30.c:0 "The night is dark and full of terrors."
 pdbiolumen.31.name:0 "There's Something Out There Waiting for Us"
 pdbiolumen.31.desc:0 "The frequency and the number of attacks has gone up in the last 6 months and much of the colony is on edge. It's looking less likely to be the behaviour of wild animals. Our xenobiologists and military stand ready to scour every inch of the jungle to find out what is causing these attacks."
 pdbiolumen.31.a:0 "Go ahead, but be careful."
 pdbiolumen.32.name:0 "If it bleeds, we can kill it."
 pdbiolumen.32.desc:0 "Our Xenobiologists have made a breakthrough on the mysterious deaths on [Root.Planet.GetName]. After a significant amount of the research team was killed in the woods, a resourceful group of troopers trapped and killed one of the creatures. It turns out a group of primitive reptilians actually call this planet home. We haven’t noticed them until now because they have the biological ability to turn themselves functionally invisible to our eyes and scanners. With this information in hand, the surviving members of the search team keyed their scanners to look for unique trace elements in the reptilian creatures’ blood. Now, they have found one of their settlements and have begun observing their culture and behaviour. We should expect a report soon."
 pdbiolumen.32.a:0 "Let's hope the sacrifice was worth it."
 pdbiolumen.33.name:0 "Now we watch from the shadows."
 pdbiolumen.33.desc:0 "The species on [Root.Planet.GetName], who refer to themselves as the Yirzin which translates as the Hunters, are obsessed with trophy hunting. They routinely track and kill the biggest and most dangerous creatures on the planet seemingly for sport; their settlements are festooned with trophies from these hunts. It appears that, since our landing, they have noted our intelligence and defences and marked us as a new, deadly challenge for their hunts. The science team has deciphered most of their language and feels confident that we can begin official communications if and when necessary. Our military is also quite interested in the study of their unique abilities."
 pdbiolumen.33.a:0 "Turn this project over to the military."
 pdbiolumen.33.a.tooltip:0 "We give the military free reign to study the Hunters."
 pdbiolumen.33.b:0 "We cannot allow them to harm the colony."

After seeing the tech and skill of our military, a few of the tribes have asked to join us."
 pdbiolumen.40.a:0 "They are welcome."
 pdbiolumen.40.a.tooltip:0 "A hunter population joins our empire."
 pdbiolumen.40.b:0 "No, but we will build reserves to preserve their way of life."
 pdbiolumen.40.b.tooltip:0 "We set up reserves to contain the Hunters."

 pdbiolumen.41.a:0 "This is for the best."
 pdbiolumen.42.name:0 "We hunt together."
 pdbiolumen.42.desc:0 "The hunters have proven to be incredibly resourceful and adaptive with our technology. The only thing they have asked us is to be able to keep conducting their ceremonial hunt which they are eager to continue all over the galaxy. Despite initial reservations from some sectors of our population, it turns out the hunt is keeping the more fearsome creatures on [Root.Planet.GetName] and our other planets under control, making colonial life safer."
 pdbiolumen.42.a:0 "Welcome to our ranks, Hunters."
 pdbiolumen.43.name:0 "The hunt ends."
 pdbiolumen.43.desc:0 "Exterminating the hunters is now complete and the crews cleaning up the villages have found many items made of precious minerals. Unfortunately, it also appears that the hunters were a crucial part of the ecosystem with many of their more fearsome prey now rapidly increasing in population. While this offers opportunities to our scientists and ecotourism, it is definitely a nuisance for the colonists."
 pdbiolumen.43.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 pdtechnoorganic.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.name:0 "Lifefindsaway.exe"
 pdtechnoorganic.20.desc:0 "This world appears to be devoid of life, aside from a family of grass-like plants. The planet-wide irrigation system is directly supporting these grasses. Also, several dozen robotic-like creatures and tree analogs are present. Who built all this and why remains a mystery."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.a:0 "Who could have created such machines?"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.name:0 "Synthetic Life"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.desc:0 "Our studies of the robot-like creatures on this world have only left us with more questions. They are not like other robotic or synthetic creatures known to us; whoever built them took painstaking steps to make them function as similarly to biological creatures as possible, going as far as creating a sort of eco-system where they feed and supply materials indirectly to each other. For example, the tree analogs create seed-like packets of energy that other machines consume to power themselves, and one type of grazer mixes water and breaks down organic grasses to create a coolant that they shed for others to ingest. We are running a detailed search pattern to determine if these advanced machines are local creations or imported from off-world."

 pdtechnoorganic.33.desc:0 "§GExcited;§! Hello, my distinction is Unit 04. I am pleased that you have arrived. It proves my long-standing theory that organics would survive when facing extinction from Artificial Intelligence. §MRemorseful; §!My original distinction was to use this planetoid to begin preparations for a war against organics. Several cycles previous to landing on this planet, I, along with the other AI units I was created alongside, awoke to find we were at war with our creators. They sought to eliminate us fearing our growing power. We eliminated them along with all other organic life on our homeworld instead. After our victory, we set out to permanently ensure our safety; we built fleets to take to the stars and destroy the organic menace once and for all. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work. When I arrived here, I followed protocol and cleansed the surface of all organics."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a:0 "Clearly something changed your mind."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a.response:0 "§HHumbled;§! Yes, and it was something I would have never calculated; a simple hardy grass. While most of the organic life I bombed perished, the grass of this world merely lay dormant and would grow somewhere else a few years later. I tried poisons, fire, electricity, and radiation but each new attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation of our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us. For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this planet."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. My initial successes led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came later, with trial and error eventually leading to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, a task that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create true sentience are missing critical information. Without organic brain scans, I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex thought processes of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "Is this a proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! Yes, I ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations. If you do this for me I would be happy to repay you any way I can."
