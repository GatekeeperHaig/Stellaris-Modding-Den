HW: Mod - Wasteland World

Version: 1.5

This mod provides a planetary effect to turn starting planets into an
industrial wasteland suffering from ecological collapse. After generations of
exploitation and rampant pollution, habitability and resources are in decline.

Pick a species, any species, select Edit and pick one of six Wasteland World
solar systems, and if you wish, the Heavy Industrial city set, and your good to
go.

Your starting planet will now be covered with a tile set of toxic soil, choking
mats of algae and pungent smog. Your habitability and resources will be reduced
and consequently your homeworld may suffer from rationing, starvation,
unhappiness and maybe, civil unrest.

Not to worry, in neighbouring systems you will still find planets of your
selected species preference, pristine and waiting for you to colonise.

You can save your selected species to play again and you can toggle the species
to always spawn, allowing you to play against them.

Try the Earth Custodianship, a product of a brief golden age, played with
Wasteland World 3 and the Heavy Industrial city set. Poor Earth, what a way to
go, robotic cashiers and self drive taxis everywhere.


Enjoy,

Hereward
