## OCEANIC planets are characterized by having a world-wide ocean, with different classes having different sea-levels / percentage of surface land / frozen surface

# Archipelagic - A habitable ocean world, with dispersed archipelagos. High percentage of temperate waters suitable for aquatic species, lower percentage of tropical lands for surface species.
