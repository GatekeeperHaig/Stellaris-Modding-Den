 tech_alpha_materialism:0 "Modernised Capitalist Economies"
 tech_alpha_materialism_desc:1 "The idea that energy can replace traditional economic forms has not really worked. Our colonies are tending towards pure energy production over commerce and social mobility is almost non-existent. Equality of living standards and lack of competition for them is leading to low productivity and slowed expansion. Now is the time to consider returning focus to a more capitalistic economic system."
 tech_alpha_fanatic_materialism:0 "Advanced Capitalism"
 tech_alpha_fanatic_materialism_desc:1 "Further ways to advance capitalist economic systems and promote productivity and expansion through social mobility and material acquisition." 
 tech_alpha_luxury_industries:0 "Luxury Industries"
 tech_alpha_luxury_industries_desc:1 "A major part of increasing the benefits of a capitalistic economic system is the production and provision of luxury items and services. You need to have something nice to want or do that costs a little extra."
 tech_alpha_fanatic_materialism_2:0 "Capitalist Agendas"
 tech_alpha_fanatic_materialism_2_desc:1 "Capitalism can invest in scientific and technological advances directed towards expanding capitalism." 
 tech_alpha_micro_fission:0 "Microfission Cores"
 tech_alpha_micro_fission_desc:1 "With powerful containment fields and quantum dimensional compression techniques, it should be possible to hold a self-sustaining micro-fission/fusion process within a relatively small core, with it taking a few billion years before they explode spectacularly. Power Banks already have the technologies we need to produce them."
 tech_alpha_shuttlecraft:0 "Shuttlecraft"
 tech_alpha_shuttlecraft_desc:1 "Rockets are very old-tech and we should invest heavily in developing re-usable single-stage to orbit aircraft that can also return and land back on the planet practically unscathed."
 tech_power_banking:0 "Power Banking"
 tech_power_banking_desc:1 "Improved methods of managing and centralising the economy of a planet in combination with energy generation and utilisation."
 tech_alpha_medical_advances:0 "Biomedical Advancements"
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_desc:1 "As new planets are colonised so our citizens are exposed to numerous new threats to their health. Thanks to that exposure and the bio-diversity available on most planets, considerable advances can be made in medical sciences."
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_2:0 "Biomedical Advancements II"
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_2_desc:1 "Increased fertility, accelerated child development and extended lifespans."
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_3:0 "Biomedical Advancements III"
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_3_desc:1 "Increased fertility, accelerated child development, improved environmental tolerances and extended lifespans."
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_4:0 "Biomedical Advancements IV"
 tech_alpha_medical_advances_4_desc:1 "Widely available transplants, genetic and general health maintaining nano-treatments and even consciousness transference to younger bodies."
 tech_matter_replication_alpha:0 "Matter Replication"
 tech_matter_replication_alpha_desc:1 "Using huge amounts of energy and quantum field manipulation, it has been possible to compress matter and convert compressed matter into large quantities of useful materials. Furthermore, scientists believe that existing mineral processing could be tweaked to create compressed matter in a convenient crystalline storage matrix."
 tech_advanced_nano_materials:0 "Advanced Nano Materials"
 tech_advanced_nano_materials_desc:1 "The efficiency of producing flexible variant alloys and plastics can be vastly improved with nanotechniques, providing us with programmable, auto-replicating materials for every purpose imaginable."
