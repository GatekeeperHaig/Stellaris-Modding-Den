 pdcrystal.10.name:0 "Space to Grow"
 pdcrystal.10.desc:0 "A report from [Root.GetLeaderName] in the [Root.GetStarName] has found a unique phenomenon on [Root.GetName].

 pdcrystal.20.desc:0 "After completing a deep scan of [Root.GetName] it has become clear that something unique is happening here. Gigantic crystal towers litter the landscape and around them, organic life proliferates in abundance. This crystal, officially dubbed Acean, has noticeable health benefits to surrounding organic lifeforms. Excitingly, the samples we removed from the planet seem to hold their effect once removed from the source. During the investigation, [Root.GetLeaderName] also found evidence of a decaying alien research outpost in the jungle and has marked the location as a candidate for archaeological study."
 pdcrystal.20.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdcrystal_site:0 "The Crystal Jungle"
 pdcrystal_site_desc:0 "The crystals on this world have shown to have a unique effect on organic flora and fauna. Setting up an in-depth study around the ancient alien research outpost could yield the secrets to its power."
 pdcrystal.50.name:0 "Holes In The Skin"
 pdcrystal.50.desc:0 "Much of the decaying base and its technology has been overwhelmed by the jungle, but we have been able to translate some relevant information. Not native to this world, the Khels as they were known, were setting up some kind of planet-wide experiment involving boreholes dug deep into the planet's crust. There was little other data at the site that was not corrupted but we did find clues pointing to the location of a larger Khel settlement not far from our research post."
 pdcrystal.50.a:0 "Interesting"
 pdcrystal.51.desc:0 "At the settlement, we found the remains of a generation ship. It seems the Khels left their home after a self-inflicted climate collapse. With a rudimentary understanding of hyperdrive technology, they sent their brightest to build a new home and rebuild their society. For several generations they wandered from system to system, failing to find a planet that could sustain them, when they found this one it seemed to be an answer to all of their problems. They landed their ship and began to build their new home."
 pdcrystal.52.desc:0 "The new colony went well for several years, the crystal pillars allowed them to harvest food transplanted from their home in abundance. But then colonists started going missing, it was slow at first and they chalked it up to random chance. However, it soon became  clear that the rate was increasing. In the pursuit to solve the disappearances, their best scientist stumbled upon something extraordinary: this planet is alive and was somehow feeding on them. Unable to launch their colony ship again, they immediately set aside all other projects to try to communicate and pacify the planet."
 pdcrystal.52.a:0 "Are we safe here?"
 pdcrystal.53.desc:0 "The study of the planet discovered it only had a rudimentary intelligence, akin to an animal incapable of reason. The lithoidic creature was a network of crystal webbings found deep under the surface and the Acean was its lure, encouraging lifeforms to gather near it by inducing growth and healing. It would then open sinkholes, devouring nearby creatures and using it's crystal webbing to feed. The Khels had to stop the planet from killing the last remnants of their people. The boreholes we found were how they attacked it: they sent an electromagnetic pulse device deep into the planet to disrupt the crystal webbing. They believed they could kill the parts of the creature that fed on them without killing the whole thing, much like a lobotomy."
 pdcrystal.53.a:0 "Horrific"
 pdcrystal.54.desc:0 "Unfortunately for them, the Khel's boreholes only sped up the planet's feeding, perhaps in an attempt to protect itself. When they were finally ready to fire their weapon, only a few dozen Khel remained. Immediately after the detonation, there was an immense surge of energy from the planet itself, followed by the end of all logs and activity from the colonists and any higher readings from the planet itself. As a final act, the creature seems to have killed its destroyers. Though they didn’t survive to see it, it appears that the Khel's were correct; the planet has lost its ability to directly feed but is not dead, instead it now passively absorbs minerals from the ground directly. This, it turns out, is the true, morbid source of the Acean crystal's powers."
 pdcrystal.54.a:0 "In the end, they killed each other."

 pdcrystal.60.name:0 "The Fate of It All"
 pdcrystal.60.desc:0 "What should be done with this lobotomized lithoid webbing creature?"
 pdcrystal.60.a:0 "Let's ease any suffering it may feel."
 pdcrystal.60.a.tooltip:0 "By leaving the mineral veins that the planet-creature used to feed itself we should be able to encourage more Acean Crystals and heighten their effect on flora and fauna."
 pdcrystal.60.b:0 "Leave it be, it's suffered enough."
 pdcrystal.60.b.tooltip:0 "We can't be sure if it feels pain and the rare crystals and minerals it produces as a by-product of its feeding are too good to ignored, but we will focus more on harvesting the unique Acean Crystals."
 pdcrystal.60.c:0 "The aliens were right to try to use the beast."
 pdcrystal.60.c.tooltip:0 "The minerals and rare crystals created by the creature's feeding should be used, but we will leave enough to keep it alive and producing a small amount of Acean Crystals."
 pdcrystal.60.d:0 "Finish the job, kill it."
 pdcrystal.60.d.tooltip:0 "The aliens didn't go far enough, we will finish the job and mine the precious minerals and rare crystals. We do not want this vile creature's Acean Crystals."
