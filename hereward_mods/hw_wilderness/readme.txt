HW: Mod - Wilderness

Version: 1.1

[deep_gravelly_voice] Terrain, Wilderness owns it!

This mod overhauls tile blockers. Gone are the days of spending a millennium
relentlessly clearing your homeworld of all tile blockers, only to find that
once you break ground on your first new world, you haven't a clue about what to
do about . . .

Now, your homeworld will have a few red tile blockers, as will all vanilla
empires, including primitives. And, new worlds will have an assortment
of yellow and red tile blockers.

Compatibility
Wilderness has been written with support for Planet Diversity, though one small
patch is still required to get the full benefit. Planet Diversity is not
required for this mod to work.

There are a number of Real Space patches. Stellar Expedition tile blockers are
fully sported. It is now possible to have Geothermal Activity appear on your
homeworld.

Custom Empires
It's very easy to add Wilderness start blockers to a homeworld. An init_effect
for generate_wilderness_blockers placed after the standard
generate_start_buildings_and_blockers and your good to go. Below are some
sample empires with Wilderness support.
