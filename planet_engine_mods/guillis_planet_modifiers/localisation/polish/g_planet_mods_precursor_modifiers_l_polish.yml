 Precursor_Energy_Grid:0 "Precursor Energy Grid"
 Precursor_Energy_Grid_desc:0 "All that remains of this ancient world is the power infrastructure of their cities and energy grids. Buildings, roads have all crumbled into ruins and dust but the energy grid still shines brightly."

 Precursor_Mines:0 "Precursor Mines"
 Precursor_Mines_desc:0 "This high mineral world was once some kind of centre of mining for an ancient forgotten civilization. Why it was abandoned is a mystery to us, but at least offers an abundance of easy to mine minerals."
 
 # 5 p
 Precursor_Shipyards:0 "Precursor Shipyards"
 Precursor_Shipyards_desc:0 "Surrounding this world are several ancient and powerful shipyards. Some appear to be quite damaged while others look like they might still be functional. Deep within these vast space stations rest a powerful graviton power core, a technology not fully understood but appears to be the source of both its power and its ability to stay in orbit for so long. Perhaps, one day, we can claim it for our own."

 Precursor_Planetary_Shield:0 "Precursor Shield Arrays"

 Precursor_Communication_Hub:0 "Precursor Communication Hub"
 Precursor_Communication_Hub_desc:0 "A single large spire is all that stands out among the ruins of this world. Still emitting light and a beam going from its centres all the way up to space. We believe this used to link up to a satellite grid. Perhaps used to communication or monitoring, we should try to use it."
