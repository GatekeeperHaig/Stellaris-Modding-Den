[h1]Ascension Perk Overhaul and Enhanced AI[/h1]

This mod overhauls the vanilla ascension perks, changing some of their bonuses, prerequisites and making sure they synergize well with various ExO mods. In addition, this mod adds sophisticated AI weights that greatly enhance the AI's ability to pick APs smartely and in relation to a great variety of factors. 
This mod is 100% savegame compatible, you can turn it ON or OFF at will. Although this mod is a standalone mod, it is an integral part of the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1185689638]ExOverhaul AI Enhancement suite[/url], which makes the Stellaris AI significantly better. 

[h1]Changes to APs[/h1]
[list]
[*] [u]Galactic Force Projection[/u]: Removed the +1 ascension perk prerequisite. 
[*] [u]Shared Destiny[/u]: Added -50% subject cooldown reduction bonus, +15% vassal naval capacity and +15% tributary tax. 
[*] [u]One Vision[/u]: removed the bonus of this AP and changed it to +1 civic points. Now available to all ethics/authorities (previously restricted to non-gestalt consciousness only).
[*] [u]Synthethic Age[/u]: this AP is now also available for Ascended Synthethic Empires - giving +2 Robot mod points to them and the -33% species modification reduction. Also reduced the prerequisite from 2 to 1 ascension perk. 
[*] [u]Consecrated Worlds[/u]: if the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1160140461]ExOverhaul: Edicts and AI[/url] mod is present alongside this mod, this AP is called Imperial Falcrum, it is gives special edicts to different ethics/authorities. If that mod is not present, this AP appears like the Consecrated worlds AP of vanilla, which is restricted to spiritualists only. 
[*] [u]Technological Ascendancy[/u]: Research speed bonus (+10%) was replaced by +25% tile research output (physics/engineering/society).
[*] [u]World Shaper[/u]: Terraforming Speed bonus increased to 75% (was 50%), terraforming cost reduction bonus increased to -33% (was -25%). Now gives both Gaia Terraformation and Climate Restoration as tech research options.
[*] [u]Master Builders[/u]: Does not simply give mega-engineering but rather gives this tech as a research option. Added -25% megastructure price reduction bonus. 
[*] [u]Machine/Cybertronic Worlds[/u]: this AP was changed to synergize with the ExOverhaul: Cybertronic Worlds mod. When this mod is present, the Ascension perk is called Cybertronic Worlds and it is available for both Machine and Synthethically ascended empires, unlocking the special artificial planets called Cybertronic Worlds. If this mod is not active, this AP is called Machine Worlds and it functions as it does in vanilla.
