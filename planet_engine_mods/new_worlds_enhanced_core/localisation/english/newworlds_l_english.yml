 # Uninhabitable Planets/bodies
 
 pc_orbiting_asteroid:0 "Orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_orbiting_asteroid_desc:0 "Possibly an asteroid that was captured by this planet's gravity.\n\n"
 pc_hot_reducing:0 "Hot Reducing World"
 pc_hot_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures."
 pc_cold_reducing:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_cold_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_volcanic:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_volcanic_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Geoinactive world."
 pc_radiated:0 "Radiated World"
 pc_radiated_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable radiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450ยบ Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200ยบ Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on Radiated worlds."
 pc_dwarf_planetoid:0 "Dwarf Planetoid"
 pc_dwarf_planetoid_desc:0 "A planetoid is a tiny world that generally does not meet the criteria for a planet, this includes moons, asteroids, and small planet-like objects. Dwarf planetoids can be composed of rock or ice, many are not even spherical, and have eccentric orbits cluttered with various even smaller objects."
 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. These planets form on the fringe of a star system."
 
 # Habitable Planets - New Worlds Originals
 
 pc_retinal:0 "Ecostable World"
 pc_retinal_desc:0 "These unusual purple worlds usually have temperate and humid climates, displaying dense vegetation that uses retinal instead of chlorophyll, possibly a result of having evolved around a star with low luminosity or as a gas-giant moon. Most Retinal worlds are tidally locked, but increased volcanic activity helps to keep conditions stable due to greenhouse effects."
 pc_retinal_habitability:0 "Retinal Habitability"
 pc_retinal_tile:0 "Forested Terrain"
 pc_retinal_tile_desc:0 "Diverse forested terrain with a humid but cold climate."

 pc_irradiated_grassland:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_irradiated_grassland_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist."
 pc_irradiated_grassland_habitability:0 "Irradiated Grasslands Habitability"
 pc_irradiated_grassland_tile:0 "Irradiated Grass Terrain"
 pc_irradiated_grassland_tile_desc:0 "Radiation-resistant grasslands."

 pc_irradiated_plains:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_irradiated_plains_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist."
 pc_irradiated_plains_habitability:0 "Irradiated Marginal Habitability"
 pc_irradiated_plains_tile:0 "Irradiated Plains Terrain"
 pc_irradiated_plains_tile_desc:0 "Irradiated and dry plains."

 trait_pc_irradiated_plains_preference_desc:0 "$trait_pc_arctic_preference_desc$"
 
 pc_lush:0 "Ecostable World"
 pc_lush_desc:0 "These lush worlds have a temperate climate with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Climate variation is very low, resulting in lush terrain dominating its land masses which are separated by mostly shallow seas. Cold and dry climates are only found near the poles and mountain tops, while deserts are usually non-existent as precepitation levels are similar in every latitude. This planet type can be considered perfect for any species that evolved in temperate worlds."
 pc_lush_habitability:0 "Lush Habitability"
 pc_lush_tile:0 "Lush Terrain"
 pc_lush_tile_desc:0 "Fertile terrain with lush vegetation, providing perfect living conditions to any forms of life adapted to temperate climates."
 trait_pc_lush_preference:0 "Lush World $preference$"
 trait_pc_lush_preference_desc:0 "$trait_pc_arctic_preference_desc$"
 
 pc_primordial:0 "Marginal World"
 pc_primordial_desc:0 "As a Molten world cools, the crust and core solidify and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right. These barren worlds are witness to much geologic activity, steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water and forms the first shallow seas, in which bacteria may develop and ultimately thrive. As the core of a Primordial planet cools, the volcanic activity lessens and the planet eventually transitions to a more inhabitable class."
 pc_primordial_habitability:0 "Primordial Habitability"
 pc_primordial_tile:0 "Barren Terrain"
 pc_primordial_tile_desc:0 "Rocky and lifeless terrain."
