This world has just the right tectonic density to peer through with our scanners. We have fully mapped out the fluid interactions of this world core.\n The data suggest that around the dense metal core there is not one but two distinct layers of molten rock and minerals. The first, inner, layer seems to behave as normal, flowing against the dense metal core and producing it's magnetic field. The fluid inner layer seems to move at the speeds we expect it to move. The outer molten layer however seems to flow in the opposite direction of the inner layer at a much slower speed.\nThis creates unique convection currents that keep them from over pressuring the tectonic plates and turning this world into a geological unstable nightmare."

It is clear a vast and powerful civilisation once resided on this world and used these energy networks not only to transfer power from one city to another, but also between everything else, from street lamps to individual rooms. A surprising addition is that they seemed to be used to light everything up as well, which would explain why they can be seen from orbit!\n\nAs for what they are made of, our scientists don't know entirely. It seems to be a combination of a translucent material core surrounded by a liquid layer of crystals with some form of super-resistant outer layer made from unknown materials.\n\nOur scientists believe that these vast networks are powered by giant thermal plants deep within the planet's crust. Unfortunately, the vast thermal vents these networks eventually lead to are too deep and too hot to currently explore.
