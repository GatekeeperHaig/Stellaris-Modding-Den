 # Vanilla Habitable planets
 pc_desert:0 "Sulfuric World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in such a world drink sulfuric acid and eat sulfur-rich foods. A water-rich environment will be hostile to them and they will favour hot and dry worlds."
 pc_arid:0 "Ammonia World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in such a world prefer cold and high-pressure environments, they may drink water as long as it has high concentrations of ammonia, and eat food rich in amines."
 pc_tundra:0 "Hydrocarbonal World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in such a world are probably silicon-based, as it is unlikely any carbon-based lifeform would adapt to the extreme cold of these environments. Water would be extremely toxic to such a species."
 pc_continental:0 "Abundant Water World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in worlds with abundant liquid water on the surface will favour the moist environments required to allow for a steady supply of biological food and fresh water. They are adaptable to some extent, but liquid water is precious to them."
 pc_tropical:0 "Bioluminescent World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in worlds with bioluminescent flora and fauna require liquid water and are sensitive to stellar luminosity, they may however be more resistant to radiation as these worlds are likely to be found in close proximity to a red dwarf or in orbit of a gas giant."
 pc_ocean:0 "Marine World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "Species who have evolved on oceanic worlds are liquely amphibian, being able to live both on land and water. They are however sensitive to temperature variations and not very adaptable to cold or hot environments."
 pc_arctic:0 "Glaciated World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in such a world are adapted to a cold environment, finding sustenance in warmer seasons and saving them to survive during colder ones, eventually conquering the cold and learning how to thrive in a frozen landscape."
 pc_alpine:0 "Negligible Water World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in a world with no detectable surface water have learned where to find it, underground. They are likely better adapted to life in a subterranean or artificial environment but feel uneasy on an open field."
 pc_savannah:0 "Limited Water World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Species who have evolved in worlds with limited surface water are likely more territorial, building their communities close to the planet's water bodies and aggressively fighting to protect them. They will likely prefer expanding to similar environments as on their mind, these will be more defensible."
 # Vanilla Uninhabitable planets
 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Also known as Jovian planets, these are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen. Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600kph. These planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 #pc_molten_desc:0 "These worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a habitable planet. The core and crust are completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and composed of hydrogen and helium. As the planet cools, the core and crust begin to harden and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Though similar in appearance to Desert worlds, these desolate worlds lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts. Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, but more complex life never evolves."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Airless World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have cold, barren surfaces and no atmosphere. While remaining highly unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets are often rich in minerals and suitable for mining."
 pc_toxic:0 "Toxic World"
 pc_toxic_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 
 # Anomalies
 TERRAFORMING_CANDIDATE_EFFECT:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will be able to be terraformed once the £society£ §H$tech_terrestrial_sculpting$§! technology has been researched."
 
 # Star localizations
 pc_b_star:0 "Blue-white Supergiant"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "These huge class A or B stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_a_star:0 "White Giant"
 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young bluish-white stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_f_star:0 "White Star"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarfs. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds."
 pc_g_star:0 "Yellow Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, K and G type stars actually range in color from whitish to slightly orange. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than red stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a yellow star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Red Supergiant"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "Stars of spectral type K or M. These are the largest stars in the universe in terms of volume, although they are not the most massive or luminous."
 pc_m_star:0 "Red Dwarf"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_t_star:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 pc_t_star_desc:0 "Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life."
 pc_m_giant_star:0 "Red Giant"
 pc_m_giant_star_desc:0 "With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits."
 
 # Start Screen Bios
 START_SCREEN_UNE:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had become a de facto world government.\n\nOver a century has passed since the loss of the Ulysses Arkships as they went through a wormhole discovered in the Sirius star system, and the subsequent social and political turmoil which prevented further space exploration initiatives, until now. With the recent completion of the first scientific starship, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!"
 START_SCREEN_CM:0 "More than a century has passed since the great ark ship Chrysanthemum carried a quarter million of our ancestors from distant Earth to the harsh world we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. After a long and perilous journey through the wormhole found in Sirius, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\n\nThe early years were difficult with marginal living conditions. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\n\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The myriad Human nations that constitute their interstellar government are disparate, yet united in purpose. These bipedal mammalians have developed a society that encourages and even thrives on individual freedoms and cultural differences - as a result, Humans tend to integrate well with alien populations.\n\nDespite this, they have strong martial traditions (produced by millennia of intermittent warfare on their homeworld) and their sometimes aggressive and unpredictable nature should not be underestimated."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Sirius star system - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a primordial alien moon. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."
