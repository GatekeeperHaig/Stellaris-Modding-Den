Its frame is mostly made out of Quberine, an extremely advanced alloy packed with incredibly complex self-repairing electronics, thus explaining how it is able to withstand the incredible forces exerted on it.\n\nOur scientists believe it might be possible to repair this thing, given enough resources and sufficiently advanced technologies. We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworld's power supply during future repairs.\n\nWhy the Squareworld's builders chose to build such a peculiar construct remains a mystery, and doubtlessly always will."
