Sadly, a few damaged sections seem to have been leaking highly radioactive content for hundreds of years. The preserved elements bear uncalculable rarity, and synthesization is extremely difficult. Also, present containment technology could barely slow the decay outside the tanks. Albeit having no commercial value, installation of proper research laboratories in the immediate surroundings is highly advised for pioneering experiments with these ultra-heavy elements, in all fields of knowledge.\n\n§HTerraforming§! this world will §RRemove§! this natural planet wonder."
