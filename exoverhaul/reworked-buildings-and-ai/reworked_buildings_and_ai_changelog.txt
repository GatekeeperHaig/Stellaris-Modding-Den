[u]Resource Buildings[/u]:

Tier 0: 25 minerals, 5 energy, 0.5 upkeep. 150 days build time.

Tier 1: 50 minerals, 15 energy, 1 upkeep. 180 days build time.

Tier 2: 75 minerals, 30 energy, 1.5 upkeep. 210 days build time.

Habitat: 200 minerals, 100 energy. 3 upkeep. 360 days build time.

Note: Habitat buildings don't need to be upgraded, so their base construction costs are higher. 

Special Resource: 150 minerals, 50 energy, 3 upkeep, 270 days build time. 

[u]Planet Unique Building[/u]

Ok, so with this data in mind, I overhauled the vanilla buildings thus: 

[h1]Standard Resource Buildings[/h1]

[u]Energy/Mineral/Food buildings[/u]: rebalanced according to t0 (basic) to t5. Research buildings have been rebalanced from t1 (basic) - t5.

[u]Habitat resource buildings[/u]: prices rebalanced. Astro-Mining Bay out increased to +6 minerals (was +4) to make it competative with solar power collectors.

[u]Mineral Processing Plant I/II[/u]: rebalanced as planet unique building t1/t2 respectively.

[u]Power Hub/Nexus[/u]: rebalanced as planet unique building t1/t2 respectively. 

[u]Mineral Silos[/u]: these buildings were [u]replaced[/u] by new buildings called [u]Hyperstorage Facilities[/u]:
[list]
[*][u]Hyperstorage Facility I[/u]: +1500/+1500 mineral/energy storage cap. +1/+1 mineral/energy adjacency bonus. 
[*][u]Hyperstorage Facility II[/u]: +1500/+1500 mineral/energy storage cap. +2/+2 mineral/energy adjacency bonus.
[*][u]Hyperstorage Facility II[/u]: +2500/+2500 mineral/energy storage cap. +2/+2 mineral/energy adjacency bonus. -10% pop consumer goods cost on planet. 
[list]

Note: The hyperstorage buildings get their own tech unlocks and are not tied to mineral processing like mineral silos are. 

[u]Capital and Ringworld Unique Resource Buildings[/u]
[list]
[*] The capital unique tier 5 mineral/energy/food buildings were reworked to give +1 adjacency bonus of their respective resource
[*] The capital unique tier 4 lab buildings were reworked to give +1 adjacency bonus of their respective research field
[*] Ringworlds get a special enhanced version of the tier 4  mineral/energy/food buildings. These buildings have a +1 higher yield of that respective resource as well as a +1 adjacency bonus. 
[*] Ringworlds get a special enhanced version of the tier 3 research lab buildings. These buildings have a +1 output and +1 adjacency bonus in their respective research field. 
[/list]

[h1]Capital Buildings[/h1]

Note: I added food output equal to 50% of its total energy production to all organic capital buildings. Machine empire/synthethic empire get minerals instead. This addition is meant to help prevent the A.I. starvation bug / machine empire weakness.

[u]Planetary Administration/Administrative Array[/u]: Added society, engineering and physics research adjacency bonuses (1/1/1). Ethics attraction bonus reduced to +10% (was 15%). 

[u]Planetary Capital/Planetary Processor[/u]:  Added society, engineering and physics research adjacency bonuses (2/2/2).

Increased the government ethics attraction bonus to +20% (was 15%). Added society, engineering and physics research adjacency bonuses (3/3/3).

[u]Habitat Administration[/u]: Energy output reduced to 4 (was 6), unity output reduced to 1 (was 2). Added minerals, energy, food, physics, society and engineering research adjacency bonuses +1/+1/+1/+1/+1/+1. Added +1000/+1000 energy/mineral cap bonuses. Reduced ethics attraction bonus to +15% (was 20%).

[h1]Planet and Tradition Unique Buildings[/h1]

[u][b]All Planet Unique Buildings rebalanced to planet unique t1/t2 stats (see above list)[/u][/b]

[u]Cloning Vats[/u]: rebalanced as t2 planet unique building. Replaced the +4 society research output with +4 food output. This building becomes much more important with ExOverhaul: Army installed and active. 

[u]Planetary Shield[/u]: rebalanced as t2 planet unique building. Replaced the physics and engineering research output and replaced these with +2 unity. Added +5 pop happiness bonus. Increased the planetary fortification bonus from +100% to +400%.

[u]Gene Clinic[/u]: rebalanced as t1 planet unique building. Society research output reduced to +1. Increased the pop growth bonus to 15% (was +10%).

[u]Gene Hospital[/u]: rebalanced as t2 planet unique building. Reduced the society research output to +2. Increased the pop growth bonus to 30% (was +20%).

[u]Military Academy[/u]: rebalanced as t2 planet unique building. Replaced the engineering and society output with +2 unity. Increased the army damage bonus to 25% (was 10%), added + 25% army heatlh and army morale bonuses. Increased the army build speed bonus to 50% (was 25%). Added +100% planet fortification bonus.

This building also becomes much more important with ExOverhaul: Army installed and active. This building was restricted to non-hive/non-machine empires only.

[u]Hive Warground[/u]: this is the hive-mind only version of the Military Academy. It has identical stats and icon, but a different name and description.

[u]War Factory[/u]: this is a Machine Terminator exclusive building in vanilla, but in vanilla this is pretty much a crap deal since armies are not that important. I decided to make this into the machine empire/synthethic empire equivalent of the militarya academy. As such this building is unlocked for machine/synthethic empires with the tech Centralized Command (like military academy). I rebalanced this building as t2 planetary unique building. Increased the army damage bonus to 25% (was 10%), added + 25% army heatlh and army morale bonuses. Increased the army build speed bonus to 50% (was 25%). Added +100% planet fortification bonus. Added +15% militarist ethics attraction. A.I. instructed to avoid building this if pacifist and prefer building this if militarist. This building also becomes much more important with ExOverhaul: Army installed and active. Finally, to make sure it still has something good for Machine Terminators - this building has a triggered resource bonus only for machine terminators, which gives them +2 unity alongside the nice engineering reseach bonus. 

[u]Spare Parts Depot[/u]: rebalanced as t1 planet unique building. Removed the society research output. Added a -10% robot build cost bonus. Added a -5% consumer goods cost bonus. 

[u]Assembly Yard[/u]: rebalanced as t2 planet unique building. Removed the society research output. Added a -20% robot build cost bonus. Added a -10% consumer goods cost bonus. 

[u]All Unity Buildings[/u]: rebalaced as t1/t2/t3 planet unique buildings. This is true for both the default unity building chain, the spiritualist building chain and the machine empire building chain. [u]I also added special hive-mind unity buildings, which are missing in vanilla. These buildings have the same stat as the normal/machine empire buildings.[/u]

[u][b]All Tradition Unique Buildings rebalanced to planet unique t3 stats (see above list)[/u][/b]

[u]Paradise Dome[/u]: reduced food output to 3 (was 4), increased unity output to 3 (was 2). I also changed the food into a triggered effect, so if and when a player does synthethic ascension the food bonus is replaced by an (+3) energy bonus :). 

[u]Visitor Center[/u]: increased unity and energy output to 3/3 (was 2/2). This building cannot be built by xenophiles. 

[u]Plurality Forum[/u]: this building is a new xenophile only version of the visitor center. It unlocks through the same tradition. It gives 4 unity, 4 energy and 4 society research. And +65% xeno migration pull, +10% habitabilty and +20% xenophile ethics attraction.
