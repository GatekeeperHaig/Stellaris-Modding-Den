 ###Ships###
 ## total number of weapons (using S slot as unit of measure - using the vanilla values):
 ## Corvette: 3S, Destroyer: 6S, Cruiser: 12S, Battleship: 24S, Dreadnought: 48S 
 ## PD slots  per ship size (corvette-dreadnought): vanilla- 0, 3, 2, 4, N/A, in the mod- 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 
 ## Torpedo slots per ship size: vanilla- 1, 0, 3, 0, in the mod: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16   
 ## Scaling of utility slots per ship size (different sections are demarcated with /): 
 ## Vanilla: Corvette- 3S+2M+1A, Destroyer- 3M/4S+1A, Cruiser- 3M/3L+2A/3M, Battleship- 2L+2A/6L/2L
 ## In the mod: Corvette- 4S+1A, Destroyer- 1M+2S+1A/1M+2S+1A, Cruiser- 2M+2S/2M+2A/2M+2S, Battleship- 2L+2M+1A/4M/2L+2M+1A, Dreadnought- 4L+1A/4L+1A/4L+1A/3L+2M
 ## L: 1/2/4/8/16
 ###Stations###
 ## In vanilla the defense platform and Defense station use the same sections, with defense station just having double the amount of sections.  
 ## The difference between defense station and fortress in vanilla is that fortress has "double" sections with double the amount of weapons and utilities, these appear as 8*sections graphically. 
 ## In the mod: I'd like to change stations so DP has 2 sections, DS has 2 double sections (i.e. double instances, hence 4 sections graphically), Fort. has 4 double sections (8 graphically), and Super-Fortress has 4 quadruple sections (16 graphically).
 ## Total number of weapons (using S as unit of measure): 
 ## Vanilla: DP 2*4S, DS 4*4S, Fort. 4*8S. 
 ## In the mod: DP 2*6S, DS 2*12S, Fort. 4*12S, Super-Fort. 4*24S
 ## Scaling of utility slots per station size (different sections are demarcated with /): 
 ## Vanilla: DP- 2*1S+1M+1L+1A, DS- 4*1S+1M+1L+1A, Fort. 4*2S+2M+2L+1A
 ## In the mod: DP- 2*2M+1S+1A, DS- 2*1L+2M+1S+1A, Fort. 4*1L+3M+1A, Super-Fort. 4*5L+1A
 ## L: 2.5/5/10/20
