[h1]Technology and A.I. Overhaul[/h1]
This mod offers a complete overhaul of the Stellaris technology files. What does this mod do?

It overhauls all vanilla technologies:
[list]
[*] It removes the useless component tech clutter - if you tech a high tier component by researching it through debris, on have a high tier component technology from an event, you will *not* receive the lower tier components in your research tree. For example, if you have tier 4 lasers, tier 3, 2 and 1 lasers *will not* appear in your tech tree. 
[*] This creates a situation that requires a readjustment of tech speed, to make sure you don't run too quickly through the tech tree. This mod therefore uses an alternative system of tech costs. This system is designed to accelerate the early game a bit and slow somewhat down the mid-game and late-game tech progression. 
[*] I also overhaul all technologies to make sure they are good. 
[/list]

This mod also:
[list]
[*] Fixes several hundred vanilla bugs in the technology files.
[*] It fixes a lot of bugs and oversights relating to machine empires and what techs they can and can't research.
[*] Overhauls the tech tree to make sure techs have proper prerequisites and offer a more balanced game. 
[*] Optimizes the vanilla weight system by removing a lot of the excess and redundant code.
[/list]

Now, this mod also offers a serious rework of the weight systems:
[list]
[*] The weights governing when techs appear have been thoroughly reworked, especially regarding weapons, making for a better tech system. 
[*] The A.I. weights have been thoroughly reworked. This is a major change that dramatically impacts the A.I. - I make sure the A.I. will tech smartly, ignore techs it will not be able to utilize or which are quite bad in vanilla. I also make sure it will prioritize weapon techs when at war, or prioritze resource development techs as strategic. [u]This change has a cascade effect on the A.I. which improves its performance.[/u]  
[/list]

This mod is compatible with all mods that do not overwrite the vanilla technologies. It has [u]integral synergy with ALL ExOverhaul mods[/u]: this is achieved using a system of hidden event flags. Once you have another ExOverhaul mod active, for example the Weapons and Component mod, the A.I. weights are readjusted to take this into account. Thus for example: in vanilla afterburners are an almost completely useless tech for the A.I., but with the weapons and components mod it is actually viable, and thus the A.I. will tech this. Furthermore, this mod has integral synergy with the following mods: [u]Glavius' A.I. megamod, which is 100% compatible with this mod[/u], and Caligula Caeser's [u]Better Spaceports and Forts[/u] and [u]More Interesting Spaceport Modules[/u]. I will also work in - today or tomorrow, integral synergy with NSC and some other mods. 

Finally, this mod introduces hundreds of changes. I did not write this in a detailed changelog since this is too much work. Below is a list of key changes introduces by this mod to the vanilla tech tree:

[list] 
[*] The tech Assault Armies was changed from a starting tech to a tier 1/1 technology and it was moved to the society tree. This makes sure that rushing is more difficult. 
[*] The tech Defense Platform was changed from a starting tech to a tier 1 technology. This also makes sure that rushing is more difficult.
[*] I changed the auto-exploration into a starting tech and readjusted the tech tree accordingly. [u]You do not another mod that changes auto-exploration[/u] when running this mod. 
[*] Made jump drive less rare but changed it to t4. It will be exceptionally hard to get this without top tier FTL tech.
[*] Gene Banks was made into an important technology (the genome research tree was reworked) and it gives an extra Biological trait point. 
[*] The restrictions on materialists access to psionic techs were removed. This synergizes with the ExOverhaul: Ethic and Government mod, which changes ethic atttractions and factions to make sure alla ascensions are viable for all ethics. 
[*] The extra civic point bonus was moved from Galactic Administration (Empire Complex) to the technology The Collective Self (both t3 technologies).
[*] Chemical Bliss was changed to a non-rare tier 1 tech. It is now a prerequisite for Neural Implants (slave processing plant) as a mini tech-branch. 
[*] The ability to [u]Robomod[/u] is unlocked at game start. I find it ridicoulus that you can't modify robots and machines until a later stage in the game. 
[*] [u]Dragon Armor and the Enigmatic Techs[/u] are obtainable as exceedingly rare techs. They have a very small chance of appearing either when (a) a different empire with which there is contact has acquired this technology (mirroring espionage), or (b) if the player already has at least 1 other enigmatic tech (does not apply for dragon armor). [u]You do not need another mod that changes Enigmatic technology appearance[/u] when running this mod - but you should know that this mod does not change events in anyway, so the enigmatic fortress event chain is not affected at all!  
[*] The special techs of Horizon Signal have been reworked to have a very small chance of appearing when a different empire with which there is contact has acquired these technologies AND built the Omega Alignment. This makes sure that these powerful technologies do not break MP game balance, or that the A.I. also has potential access to these techs in SP games once Horizon Signal fires - horizon signal is restricted to non-A.I. players, so its highly imbalanced. 
[*] Research leaders are much more important in this mod for two reasons: 1. I fix several hundred errors in the vanilla tech files in which research leaders were incorrectly inputed in the files. For example, a society/biology technology would have a higher chance of appearing if you had a leader with an engineering specialty in the physics science slot, and the A.I. was geared to pick it based on its engineering scientist. This is not a joke, if this interest you see my post in the Stellaris PDX forum [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/so-many-mistakes-in-the-tech-files-its-amazing.1050024/]here[/url]. 2. I rationalized the system in which rare techs have a higher chance of appering depending on tech leader. In vanilla its a mass, often the best chance is to have either a Curator or a Maniacal leader, with Spark of Genius also often - but not always - impacting this. I reworked this thus: If your leader has either/or the Psionic/Spark of Genius/Curator trait it gives a 200% chance of getting a rare tech. If your leader has either/or the Maniacal/Synthethic/A.I. Sapient Assistant traits it has 150% chance of getting a rare tech. If it has a trait from both categories the bonuses stack(!). This also makes sure that the Psionic Trait is great to have on a tech leader.

Hope you enjoy. Please let me know if there are any issues or requests. 

PLZ rate this mod if you like it! This really helps making the mod more visible on the workshop. And if you don't like it, tell me how you'd improve it.
