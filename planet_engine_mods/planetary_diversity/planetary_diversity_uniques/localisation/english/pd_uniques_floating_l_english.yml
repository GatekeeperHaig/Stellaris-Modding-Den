 sr_eludium:0 "Eludium Ore"
 sr_eludium_desc:0 "This exotic substance has many properties that seemingly defy the laws of physics. Only found on this planet, its effects ​on gravity can​ ​change the mass of matter. It is also an effective superconductor."
 pdfloating.10.name:0 "Impossible Planet"
 pdfloating.10.desc:0 "We have received a strange report from the [Root.GetName] which is currently in the [Root.GetStarName] System. Previous long-range scans had confirmed a large moon orbiting a gas giant in the system, but the radiation from the giant had kept most details a mystery. Despite the captain having the scanners checked over for errors, short-range scans now appear to show the landmasses of this planet are floating in the sky. [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested we get a science team to investigate immediately."
 pdfloating.10.a:0 "How is this possible?"
 pdfloating.20.name:0 "Islands in the Sky"
 pdfloating.20.desc:0 "The report from [Root.GetLeaderName] has provided some incredible results. This planet seems to have an element that has not been found anywhere else in the galaxy. Despite the captain's best efforts the science team has unoriginally dubbed the element... 'Eludium'. Eludium seems to have properties that defy the laws of physics as it is able to negate the effects of gravity on matter. That aside, it also appears to be a highly efficient superconductor. Holding this planet as a colony would be a great asset to both science and energy production."
