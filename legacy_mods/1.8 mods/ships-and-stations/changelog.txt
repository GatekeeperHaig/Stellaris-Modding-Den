[h1]ExBalance: Ship Hulls, Armor, Shield and Aux Overhaul[/h1]

This mod overhauls vanilla ships and stations to offer a more balanced and interesting gameplay. 

What this mod does?

This mod improves the balance of ships and stations by making sure their respectivce hull sizes and sections are balanced. It also adds quite a bit of extra sections to the game and especially a new component range that makes ships and stations scale. 

[h1]This mod containsp[/h1]
[list]
[*]A new integral ship and station component range called "Hull Architecture". This component appears just next to combat computers and sensors, and it has 5 levels. It creates a sort of level scaling, as each level of Ship or Station Architecture gives serious bonuses. The bonuses of Ship and Station architecture are not identical.[*]A new integral station component range called "Station Hull Architecture".

[h1]Ship Architecture Bonuses[/h1]
Ship Architecture is a "required component" - like sensors, FTL drive and combat computer, which is limited to military ships only.

[u]Level II:[/u] +25% Shield HP, +25% HP, +5% Evasion, +25% Shield Regen, +5 Armor, -15% Emergency FTL Damage.
[u]Level III:[/u] +50% Shield HP, +50% HP, +10% Evasion, +50% Shield Regen, +10 Armor, -30% Emergency FTL Damage.

[h1]Rebalance of all vanilla auras[/h1]

[u]Note:[/u]
	-Added scaling to all aura components, so the larger the component is the better its bonus. 
	-Moved each aura component type to a seperate ID, so their affects do not compete.
	-Increased aura radius: small aura range 90, medium 110, large 130.

[h1]Combat Computer Bonuses[/h1]
Combat computers have been completely rebalanced, although I tried to preserve the vanilla conceptualiation of different ship classes sizes being better at specific tasks (e.g. corvettes are more evasive, destroyers have better tracking, etc.). I have not though touched the predefined ship-behaviors, and each level of computer still refers to the vanilla predefined behaviors. Below is a list of bonuses, beginning from level II.

[h1]Station Section Templates[/h1]
[list]
[*]Defense Platform and Defense Station sections were split. The former sections are now defense platform only sections.
[*]Added special sections for defense station. These sections are twice as powerful as the defense platform sections, and half as powerful as the fortress sections.
[*]Added XL weapons for defense stations and fortresses. Since the regular XL weapons all have a 25 degree firing arc, and are thus dependent on a ship's manuevering (i.e. rotation + combat rotation), I decided to bypass this by creating a station specific version of each XL weapon which does not have these limitations. The alternative was to give stations rotation, but this doesn't work well with the existing combat mechanics (weapon impacts stop station rotation it appears). Nonetheless, the XL weapons appear identical for all intents and purposes.
