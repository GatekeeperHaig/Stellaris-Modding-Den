##### Making Compatibility Triggers and Effects
#Making compatibility triggers and effects is very easy.
#The mod that holds the content being checked by the trigger or effect will store the triggers. 
#for example:
#
#is_star_class_sc_o ={ is_star_class = sc_o }
#is_planet_class_pc_mangrove ={ is_planet_class = pc_mangrove }
#has_resource_sr_exotic_spices ={ has_resource = { type = sr_exotic_spices amount > 0 } }
#
#these triggers are stored in a file that loads last - in this instance beginning with the letters zz_ to make sure it loads last.
#
#the triggers can now be used by another mod with no error.log message using empty triggers:
#
#is_star_class_sc_o ={ always = no }
#is_planet_class_pc_mangrove ={ always = no }
#has_resource_sr_exotic_spices ={ always = no }
#
#the empty triggers need to be stored in a file that loads before the previous file. So the files begin in a letter or symbol lower than z.
#
#The principal for effects is almost identical, with one key difference: the file hosting the actual effects (common/scripted_effects)
#must load first, and it thus needs to have a letter or symbol as low as possible (lowest being !).
