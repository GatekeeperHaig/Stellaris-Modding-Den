 # Uninhabitable Planets/bodies
 
 pc_orbiting_asteroid:0 "Orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_orbiting_asteroid_desc:0 "Possibly an asteroid that was captured by this planet's gravity.\n\n"
 pc_hot_reducing:0 "Hot Reducing World"
 pc_hot_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures."
 pc_cold_reducing:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_cold_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_volcanic:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_volcanic_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Geoinactive world."
 pc_radiated:0 "Scorched World"
 pc_radiated_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable irradiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres (if any) are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450 degrees Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200 degrees Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on Radiated worlds."
 pc_dwarf_planetoid:0 "Dwarf Planetoid"
 pc_dwarf_planetoid_desc:0 "A planetoid is a tiny world that generally does not meet the criteria for a planet, this includes moons, asteroids, and small planet-like objects. Dwarf planetoids can be composed of rock or ice, many are not even spherical, and have eccentric orbits cluttered with various even smaller objects."
 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. These planets form on the fringe of a star system."
 
 # Habitable Planets - New Worlds Originals
 
 pc_primordial:0 "Primordial World"
 pc_primordial_desc:0 "As a Molten world cools, the crust and core solidify and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right. These barren worlds are witness to much geologic activity, steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water and forms the first shallow seas, in which bacteria may develop and ultimately thrive. As the core of a Primordial planet cools, the volcanic activity lessens and the planet eventually transitions to a more inhabitable class."
 pc_primordial_habitability:0 "Primordial Habitability"
 pc_primordial_tile:0 "Barren Terrain"
 pc_primordial_tile_desc:0 "Rocky and lifeless terrain."
 trait_pc_primordial_preference:0 "Primordial World $preference$"
 trait_pc_primordial_preference_desc:0 "$trait_pc_arctic_preference_desc$"
 
 pc_desolate:0 "Desolate World"
 pc_desolate_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life. Water can be found either on the surface in frozen state or in deep underground reservoirs."
 pc_desolate_habitability:0 "Desolate Habitability"
 pc_desolate_tile:0 "Desolate Terrain"
 pc_desolate_tile_desc:0 "Rocky barren landscape."
 trait_pc_desolate_preference:0 "Desolate World $preference$"
 trait_pc_desolate_preference_desc:0 "$trait_pc_arctic_preference_desc$"
 
 pc_irradiated_marginal:0 "Irradiated Marginal World"
 pc_irradiated_marginal_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some marine vegetation and life to exist."
 pc_irradiated_marginal_habitability:0 "Irradiated Marginal Habitability"
 pc_irradiated_marginal_tile:0 "Irradiated Marginal Terrain"
 pc_irradiated_marginal_tile_desc:0 "Irradiated and dry terrain."

 trait_pc_irradiated_marginal_preference_desc:0 "$trait_pc_arctic_preference_desc$"
 
 pc_marginal_warm:0 "Warm Marginal World"
 pc_marginal_cold:0 "Cold Marginal World"
 pc_marginal_warm_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, are generally similar to Terrestrial planets, but with sub-optimal conditions, either due to toxicity, atmospheric pressure, gravity or other elements. The Warm sub-class tends to be rocky and forested, and while they are suitable for life, the scarce water supply makes natural evolution more difficult."
 pc_marginal_cold_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, are generally similar to Terrestrial planets, but with sub-optimal conditions, either due to toxicity, atmospheric pressure, gravity or other elements. The Cold sub-class tends to be frigid and rocky, with large bodies of frozen water, except in lower latitudes where liquid water and vegetation can be found."
 pc_marginal_warm_habitability:0 "Warm Marginal Habitability"
 pc_marginal_cold_habitability:0 "Cold Marginal Habitability"
 pc_marginal_warm_tile:0 "Temperate Terrain"

 ###Terraforming Modifier

 ###NW Engine Start Sol
 nwengine.09.name:0 "New Worlds Sol Start"
 nwengine.09.desc:0 "Rumours from the private sector claim Venus and Titan have underground deposits of liquid or frozen water that might allow Human colonies to develop there. Do you want to investigate these rumours?\n\n§GOption A:§!Ridiculous.\n\n§GOption B:§!If Venus could be developed, it could one day rival the Earth, send an exploration team to investigate, but ignore the rumours about Titan, its too cold anyway.\n\n§GOption C:§!Venus is too hot, how could we ever change such an environment? But if there's even a remote possibility of having an outpost in the outer system on Titan, we should not ignore it!\n\n§GOption D:§!Any private company able to operate outside our planet should be taken seriously! Explore both possibilities."
