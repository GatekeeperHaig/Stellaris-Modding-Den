 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hw_naeb_desc:0 "The Naeb Aggregation are a peaceful aquatic race driven by the necessity to adapt and colonise other worlds as their aged homeworld slowly cools and freezes.\n\nFor an eternity they have lived a secluded live in the deep oceans of their homeworld. Unfortunately their world is growing old, is growing cold. As the sun grows dim their world has been slowly freezing and thick ice covers their great oceans. Whilst the rest of the galaxy ignored their frozen and apparent lifeless world, they developed great scientific achievements powered by geothermal energy, but the core of their world has begun to cool also. Now they have had to adapt their  technology to live on the surface of their world as the ocean's ice grows thicker.\n\nWith a desperate desire to save their ancient race they channelled their scientific pursuits to adaptation and space flight. With powerful ships laden with their watery environment, they venture out into space looking for other worlds to colonise."
