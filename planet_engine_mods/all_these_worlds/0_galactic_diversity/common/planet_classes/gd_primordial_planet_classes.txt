## PRIMORDIAL classes are Terrestrial worlds in an early geological evolutionary phase.

## Geoplastic - A semi-molten world with toxic atmosphere, oceans havent formed yet so the surface is still barren and devoid of life.

## Geometallic - As the surface cools, steam expelled from volcanic activity over the eons condenses in the atmosphere and falls to the surface as rain, leading to the formation of the first oceans, where primitive marine life originates.

## Geocrystallic - As the planet continues to cool, volcanic activity decreases and life continues to evolve taking advantage of the improved environment. Atmospheric toxicity lessens as vegetation spreads in the surface and the first land-based fauna begin to evolve.
