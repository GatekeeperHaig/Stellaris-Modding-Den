 ###Planet Classes - Uninhabitable
 pc_orbiting_asteroid:0 "Orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_orbiting_asteroid_desc:0 "Possibly an asteroid that was captured by this planet's gravity.\n\n"
 pc_hot_reducing:0 "Hot Reducing World"
 pc_hot_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures."
 pc_cold_reducing:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_cold_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_volcanic:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_volcanic_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Geoinactive world."
 pc_radiated:0 "Scorched World"
 pc_radiated_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable irradiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres (if any) are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450 degrees Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200 degrees Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on Radiated worlds."
 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. These planets form on the fringe of a star system."
 pc_waterworld:0 "Water Ocean World"
 pc_waterworld_desc:0 "An oceanic world completely covered in water. A strong magnetosphere and atmospheric pressure allow the ocean to be retained over long geological time scales."
 pc_ethaneworld:0 "Ethane Ocean World"
 pc_ethaneworld_desc:0 "An oceanic world completely covered in ethane. A strong magnetosphere and atmospheric pressure allow the ocean to be retained over long geological time scales."
 ###Planet Classes - Habitable
 pc_cryothalassic:0 "Oceanic World"
 pc_cryothalassic_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. A world-wide ocean covers more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 
 ###Star Classes
 pc_d_star:0 "White Dwarf"
 pc_d_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star. A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool." 
 
 ###Habitable Query

 gdengine.08.desc:0 "§WAs we reach for the stars, we need to set expectations regarding the chances of finding worlds capable of supporting life. How common do you believe habitable worlds are?\n\n§GVery High:§! I would be very disappointed if on average we don't find one habitable planet for each star in the galaxy.\n\n§GHigh:§! I'm sure there must be many star systems with at least one habitable world.\n\n§GLow:§! I'm expecting it will take some effort to find them, but it is a big galaxy.\n\n§GVery Low:§! We should consider ourselves lucky to find rocks we can mine for resources, the day we find another livable world will become a new universal holyday."

 ###Decisions
 decision_star_chart:0 "Star Chart Project"
