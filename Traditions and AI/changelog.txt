This mod overhauls traditions and ascensions perks. It is compatible with such popular tradition expanding mods as Plentiful Traditions and Additional Traditions. It is also compatible with the Ethics and Government Rebuild mod - without its tradition overhaul component. This mod is savegame compatible. 

Although this mod - like all of my mods - is a standalone mod, I highly recommend using it in combination with my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1146723673]Ethics and Government[/url] overhaul mod and my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148627093]Buildings[/url] overhaul mod. Both of these mods have been designed to synergize with this mod, and it will make the overall game experience more streamlined. 

What does this mod do? 

The TL;DR is that it overhauls more than 50% of the vanilla traditions, offering what is to my mind a more interesting, better balanced and less samey paradigm. I also change some of the icons, add several buildings (see the pictures above), and rewrite quite a bit of the fluff text. For a full list of changes please see ----> the CHANGELOG.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is one of the most complicated mods I made thus far- not because it was difficult to mod, but rather because of the sheer amount of details I had to keep track of and adjust. There will be some mistakes in this mod, certainly with fluff text and descriptions. Please let me know if you find a mistake and I'll fix it ASAP. Also, if you think some change is not good, or you have a suggestion, please tell me so in the comments.
