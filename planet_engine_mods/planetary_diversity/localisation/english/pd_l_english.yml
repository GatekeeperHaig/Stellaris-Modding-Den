 #floating world
 pdfloating.10.name:0 "Impossible Planet"
 pdfloating.10.desc:0 "We have received a strange report from the [Root.GetName] which is currently in the [Root.GetStarName] System.  Previous long-range scans had confirmed a large moon orbiting a gas giant in the system, but the radiation from the giant had kept most details a mystery.  Despite the captain having the scanners checked over for errors, short-range scans now appear to show the landmasses of this planet are floating in the sky.  [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested we get a science team to investigate immediately."
 pdfloating.10.a:0 "How is this possible?"
 pdfloating.20.name:0 "Islands in the Sky"
 pdfloating.20.desc:0 "The report from [Root.GetLeaderName] has provided some incredible results.  This planet seems to have an element that has not been found anywhere else in the galaxy.  Despite the captain's best efforts the science team has unoriginally dubbed the element… 'Eludium'.  Eludium seems to have properties that defy the laws of physics as it is able to negate the effects of gravity on matter.  That aside, it also appears to be a highly efficient superconductor.  Holding this planet as a colony would be a great asset to both science and energy production." 
 pdfloating.20.a:0 "Amazing." 

 #crystal world
 pdcrystal.10.name:0 "Space to Grow"
 pdcrystal.10.desc:0 "We have received a strange report from the [Root.GetName] which is currently in the [Root.GetStarName] System.  Immediately upon exiting hyperspace the botany laboratory reported that plant life on the ship started an accelerated growth pattern.   Sensors have picked up what appears to be a faint and unusual electromagnetic field originating from one of the planets in the system.  [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested we get a science team to investigate immediately."
 pdcrystal.10.a:0 "Take a closer look."
 pdcrystal.20.name:0 "Crystal World"
 pdcrystal.20.desc:0 "The report from [Root.GetLeaderName] has provided some incredible results.  Once on the surface, the away team reported that the planet has concentrations of a giant crystals all over.  It's unclear at this point how deep they go under through the planet's crust.  The team has begun to refer to it as 'Acean Crystal', a name none of the team is taking credit for but seems to have simultaneously come to everyone's mind.  The whole away team reported feeling rested and rejuvenated while on the surface, one crewman reported that a childhood scar has healed completely.  The planet has an almost seductive quality, [Root.GetLeaderName] said it took a considerable amount of convincing to get the team to return to the ship on schedule.  The captain and crew completely agree that the planet's unusual qualities should make it a priority to hold."
 pdcrystal.20.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdcrystal.30.name:0 "Forgotten Temple"
 pdcrystal.30.desc:0 "An ancient temple has been found on [Root.GetName].  A planetary science team is already on site and they have entered the temple.  They insisted that they report to you directly and are on hold for you."
 pdcrystal.30.a.tooltip:0 "On Screen."
 pdcrystal.40.name:0 "A Focused Exploration"
 pdcrystal.40.desc:0 "Can you hear me Sir?  I'm sorry for the intrusion but something has happened.  The temple we found is made entirely of Acean crystal, and what's more, it seems to somehow focus and amplify the natural energy field of the crystal.  We have no idea how but once we entered the temple it scanned us.  The crystal then began to emit a glow that coursed its way to one central pillar before momentary shooting a burst of energy into the sky.  There's no clues about who might have built this or if it was built at all; there are no linguistic markings, no artifacts, and no advanced technology.  Scanners are showing that the temple is spreading some kind of field much past the range of this system."
 pdcrystal.40.a:0 "Is there any danger?"
 pdcrystal.40.a.response:0 "As we don't know how this was made, and what its used for, we're not sure.  What we do know is that the energy field is only heading towards systems we control, but we have no idea how.  Perhaps when it scanned us it attuned itself to us.  We'll keep running tests but we really don't know what this could mean."
 pdcrystal.40.b:0 "Are we able to destroy the temple?"
 pdcrystal.40.b.response:0 "While there's no reason to believe we couldn't, I wouldn't rush to that decision until we have more information. If our people are in fact attuned to the crystal we don't know what side effects disconnecting could have."
 pdcrystal.40.c:0 "Then we will monitor and hope for the best?"
 pdcrystal.40.c.response:0 "I suppose only time will tell, but for what it's worth... this place, puts me completely at ease.   Everything about this feels right, and the whole team agrees; we have a good feeling about this."
 pdcrystal.40.d:0 "Very well, thank you for your report."
 pdcrystal.40.d.response:0 "Of course sir, we'll continue to monitor while it's decided what should be done."
 pdcrystal.50.name:0 "Final Decision"
 pdcrystal.50.desc:0 "Government officials and the public are up in arms and deeply divided about the Temple of Acean.  Some say that it must be destroyed while others say it is a gift to be cherished.   It's time to decide what to do about it."
 pdcrystal.50.a:0 "We allow the Temple to exist and use it."
 pdcrystal.50.a.tooltip:0 "The temple stays standing the empire is free reap the benefits."
 pdcrystal.50.b:0 "We destroy the Temple."
 pdcrystal.50.b.tooltip:0 "A crew will start work to dismantle the temple immediately."
 pdcrystal.50.c:0 "We decree this temple a Holy Site of the people."
 pdcrystal.50.c.tooltip:0 "This planet and the temple will be designated a holy site for our people."
 pdcrystal.50.d:0 "Get every scanner we have to that temple."
 pdcrystal.50.d.tooltip:0 "Our top scientists will do a deep scan of the temple before we make a decision."
 pdcrystal.51.name:0 "A Terrible Mistake"
 pdcrystal.51.desc:0 "No sooner than we got word that the demolition team had begun dismantling the temple, the field extended by the planet changed drastically.  Following the change psionic trauma was simultaneously felt by all citizens.  We haven't been able to reach the colony and we fear the worst."
 pdcrystal.51.a:0 "What have we done?"
 pdcrystal.51.a.tooltip:0 "The planet has been eaten by some kind of psionic energy."
 pdcrystal.52.name:0 "A New Frontier."
 pdcrystal.52.desc:0 "The deep scans have lead to an incredible discovery.  The fields that run through the crystals and the planet can only be described as being psionic in nature.  What months ago we would have dismissed as superstition or mumbo jumbo can now, thanks to the temple, be measured and understood.  Psionics are real, it's all real.  There's so much more to learn and we have only scratched the surface but this place has given us the key."
 pdcrystal.52.a:0 "How could we have been so wrong?"
 pdcrystal.52.a.tooltip:0 "We have taken the first step into unlocking the powers of the mind."
