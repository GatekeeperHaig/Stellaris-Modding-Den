The temple we found is made entirely of Acean crystal, and what's more, it seems to somehow focus and amplify the natural energy field of the crystal.  We have no idea how but once we entered the temple it scanned us.  The crystal then began to emit a glow that coursed its way to one central pillar before momentary shooting a burst of energy into the sky.  There's no clues about who might have built this or if it was built at all; there are no linguistic markings, no artifacts, and no advanced technology.  Scanners are showing that the temple is spreading some kind of field much past the range of this system."
 pdcrystal.40.a:0 "Is there any danger?"
 pdcrystal.40.a.response:0 "As we don't know how this was made, and what its used for, we're not sure.  What we do know is that the energy field is only heading towards systems we control, but we have no idea how.  Perhaps when it scanned us it attuned itself to us.  We'll keep running tests but we really don't know what this could mean."
 pdcrystal.40.b:0 "Are we able to destroy the temple?"
 pdcrystal.40.b.response:0 "While there's no reason to believe we couldn't, I wouldn't rush to that decision until we have more information. If our people are in fact attuned to the crystal we don't know what side effects disconnecting could have."
