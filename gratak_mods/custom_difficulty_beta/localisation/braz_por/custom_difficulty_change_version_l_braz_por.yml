Due to major changes in modifiers and other functions, a reset of the mod settings is required to update. You can choose whether to update now or to finish your game first. I'm very sure the update is save, but you will have to configure the difficulty anew. If you want to update, click the reset option, save and close the game, activate the new version of the mod and deactivate the beta. Then you can start the game again and load this save-game. You should be greeted by the new mod welcome screen."
