 # Vanilla Uninhabitable planets
 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"

 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "\nMolten worlds are typically young worlds with a crust that has yet to harden. These planets usually cool and evolve into a different class, some with the right conditions may even one day support life, while others may remain molten indefinitely due to tidal forces if they are too close to a star or in orbit of a gas giant."

 pc_frozen_desc:0 "\nTelluric worlds are rocky planets composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. These worlds have solid surfaces, with an interior structure consisting of a metallic core and a surrounding silicate mantle.\n\nThe Frozen-class has a surface composed of rocky materials and volatile ices, and some may have subsurface liquid oceans if warmed by internal heat or tidal forces."
 pc_barren:0 "Telluric World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "\nTelluric worlds are rocky planets composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. These worlds have solid surfaces, with an interior structure consisting of a metallic core and a surrounding silicate mantle.\n\nThe Dusty-class is a barren world large enough to retain an atmosphere, with a surface deeply covered by finely grained iron oxide dust."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Telluric World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "\nTelluric worlds are rocky planets composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. These worlds have solid surfaces, with an interior structure consisting of a metallic core and a surrounding silicate mantle.\n\nThe Silicate-class is a dead world with a high concentration of silicon conpounds on the surface, often riddled with meteor impact craters preserved through the ages due to the lack of any forms of erosion or geological activity."
