 Utopian_World:0 "Mundo Utópico" 
 Utopian_World_desc:0 "Ni una sola pista de pollución, de toxicidad o enfermedad. Este mundo es hermoso en todo sentido. Edificios brillan como si no fueran afectados por los elementos. Sonido, luz, todo parece danzar con su población. Cada pedazo de superficie parece fluír hacia la ciudad y de vuelta nuevamente. casi en perfecta harmonía."
 
 Utopian_Services:0 "Servicios Utópicos" 
 Utopian_Services_desc:0 "Este mundo ofrece a todo a sus residentes. Desde longevidad hasta abundancia de comida. Todo se provee y se arregla."
 
 Primitive_Reserve:0 "Reserva Primitiva" 
 Primitive_Reserve_desc:0 "Una gigantesca estructura parecída a un domo parece no mostrar signos de vida avanzada, de hecho, lo que parece ser vida primitiva es todo lo que merodea en su interior. Un vistazo al pasado de una especie quizás. O un retorcido tipo de zoológico."

 Unified_Processing:1 "Unified Processing"
 Unified_Processing_desc:1 "The surface and structures of this world are covered in highly advanced networks of processing units. The entire world acts as a single computational system allowing for some very impressive capability in terms of calculations. From what we can gather by the inhabitants' actions it looks like it is used as a giant framework for a virtual world. Perhaps a way to escape the existential dread of reality. Or perhaps it is simply used as a means for entertainment."

While this shield does not stop energy or projectiles it slows them down enough to buy the planet's inhabitants enough time to seek shelter and probably mount a counteroffensive. It looks like the systems powering this shield are perfectly spread around the planet in such a way they form complex but symmetrical patterns."

 Living_Infrastructure:1 "Living Infrastructure"
 Living_Infrastructure_desc:1 "It looks like the infrastructure of this world is made up of nanites or some other form of living artificial matter. The buildings, streets and some parts of the land itself seem to constantly shift and mold into different shapes depending on the needs of the inhabitants. Truly this is the pinnacle of infrastructure engineering. To have anything specifically tailored to your needs is almost utopian!"

 Galactic_Databanks:1 "Galactic Databanks"
 Galactic_Databanks_desc:1 "Throughout this world there are massive data centres housing countless of databanks. The purpose of these data banks is to house the galaxy's largest collection of information about everything there is. From the tiniest particle of matter, the many states of energy to every type of living organism found in this galaxy."

 Monument_To_The_Fallen:1 "Monument To The Fallen"
 Monument_To_The_Fallen_desc:1 "Centre in the capital of this world is a giant statue reaching all the way into the higher stratosphere. This monumental building seems to be dedicated to the fallen warriors of this species. The many images displayed across this statue depict fierce and massive battles between the warriors of this species and what appears to be entities coming from another dimension through various portals. No doubt these warriors won in the end, but many seemed to have paid victory with their lives. This mysterious enemy of theirs must have been exceptionally powerful for them to dedicate such a tribute to their victory and their fallen.."
