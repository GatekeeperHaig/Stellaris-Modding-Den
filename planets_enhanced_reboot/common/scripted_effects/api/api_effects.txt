### The table below is for unique resources only. fill it the same way as the previous table
### if a unique resource is supposed to be orbital, make sure the orbital limit is used on the tile (see comment in example rubric)
### Resources spawned with this table spawn a maximum of a single planet per galaxy
### you can make it so they don't always spawn by changing the values on the random_list
### see the relevant comments.
