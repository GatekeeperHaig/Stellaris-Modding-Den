You think that the AI is too slow in research while overwhelming you in allow production in early game? You think that the base influence production is way too low to expand at a decent pace? You think pop growth/assembly speed is too high/low? You think that three rivals are simply not enough for you? You want more starbases or starbase trade protected or collection range should be higher if you play with few planets settings? You think wars still end too fast because of war exhaustion? Or, or, or...

Then this mod is for you!

Extension to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590362799]Dynamic Difficulty 2.2.x - Ultimate Customization[/url] or Standalone. Can be installed and uninstalled separately.

[h1]Features[/h1]
1. Allows you to easily add a total of 61 different modifiers in 12 levels each to player(s) and/or AIs. 
2. Can be combined with the modifiers of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590362799]Dynamic Difficulty 2.2.x - Ultimate Customization[/url] or the vanilla difficulty modifiers.
3. Allows locking of the customized difficulty for MP or other reasons. Unlock via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1354362281]sub-mod[/url]. Also automatically locks all but host in MP.

[h1]IMPORTANT[/h1]
- Main menu can be opened via [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1087781345]Mod Menu[/url] (same button as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590362799]Dynamic Difficulty 2.2.x - Ultimate Customization[/url])
- Alternatively, the menu is started via a Country Edict.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
- Events only run when closing the menu. 
- Added static modifiers may slow down the game a bit (no ideas about the internals of Stellaris).

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Can be added into a running game. You need to wait 1 day in this case before being able to open the menu.
- Can be uninstalled during a game (removing all added modifiers). Simply removing the mod will leave over "?" modifiers (who won't do anything), but there is an "uninstall" option in the Menu.
- Should have basically no conflicts with other mods. The only thing I can think of is mods adding completely new empire types like the "Ascended Empire" of Zenith (which is supported). If you know of any other such mod, just tell me and I can easily add it as well.
- Created for Stellaris 2.2.*. Some modifiers should work in 2.1.*, thus you could try it with that version. Modifiers not working in that version should mostly have empty localization, so you would recognize those.
- (Obviously) Not Achievement compatible.

[h1]Localization[/h1]
- "pt","en","fr", "de","pl","ru", "es","simp_chinese" language files given but all mostly English. Most modifier and difficulty names are links to the Vanilla localization and are thus translated automatically.
