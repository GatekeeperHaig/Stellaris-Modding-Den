##### Making Compatibility Triggers and Effects
#Making compatibility triggers and effects is very easy.
#The mod that holds the content being checked by the trigger or effect will store the triggers. 
#For example, Real Space stores triggers to check its unique star classes:
#
#is_star_class_sc_o ={ is_star_class = sc_o }
#is_star_class_sc_o_super ={ is_star_class = sc_o_super }
#is_star_class_sc_o_hyper ={ is_star_class = sc_o_hyper }
#
#these triggers are stored in a file that loads last - in this instance beginning with the letters zz_ to make sure it loads last.
#
#the triggers can now be used by another mod with no error.log message using empty triggers:
#
#is_star_class_sc_o ={ }
#is_star_class_sc_o_super ={ }
#is_star_class_sc_o_hyper ={ }
#
#the empty triggers need to be stored in a file that loads before the previous file. So the files begin in a letter or symbol lower than z.
#
#The principal for effects is almost identical, with one key difference: the file hosting the actual effects (common/scripted_effects)
#must load first, and it thus needs to have a letter or symbol as low as possible (lowest being !).
