HW: Species - Rwaddi Shrewdness

Version: 1.2

The Rwaddi Shrewdness are a race of arboreal primates more at home on their
jungle world of Juelow than they are at spacefaring.

Rwaddi society is highly organised around the family, the tribe. All adults are
responsible for the care of the young and the young have the freedom to explore
and learn at will. Consequently the Rwaddi have no concept of schooling as
their young learn all they need from the wider community. When a young Rwaddi
reaches adolescence they know from what has inspired them during childhood,
what path to take as an adult. Though the individual may lack certain knowledge,
each generation as a whole continues to grow in strength of wisdom, passing on
to the next generation a growing wealth.

This is a reworking of a species from a pack I originally developed for Galactic
Civilizations (that only plays in Windows). Having converted to Linux I am so
pleased to discover Stellaris. The full species pack includes;

* Naeb Aggregation - A peaceful aquatic race driven by the necessity to adapt
and colonise other worlds as their aged homeworld slowly cools and freezes.

* Pharaonic Malignity - Having heavily polluted their homeworld with the
consumption of hydrocarbon fuels the Pharaonic Malignity are now looking for
other worlds to colonise, or conquer.

* Rwaddi Shrewdness - The Rwaddi are a race of arboreal primates who are more
at home on their jungle world than they are at spacefaring.

* Stratus Urbanites - The Stratus live on an arid world with twin moons. Their
homeworld draws tourist from afar to view their amazing cities and the romantic
views of the moons.

Enjoy,

Hereward
