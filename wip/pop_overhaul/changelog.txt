This mod overhauls robot and machine empire gameplay. It is savegame compatible and is designed to work in synergy with the othe ExOverhaul mods - although these are not required, particularly my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1146723673]Ethics and Government Overhaul[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1150146305]1.8.* Tweaks[/url] mods. 

What does this mod do?
The TL;DR version is that it overhauls robotic and machine pops, their traits, and some of their civics. At the same time, this mod reduces the restrictions on spiritualists and robots, and rebalances the materialist robot attractions. For the non-TL;DR version read below: 

[h1]Changes to Machine Empires[/h1]
[list]
[*] I added to the [u]Machine Intellignece Authority[/u] +5% pop production bonus and -66% modify species cost. This change was done to alleviate a bit the overall weakness of machine empires during early game, and to make robomodding more viable.  
[*] To fix a bit the current UPness of [u]Machine Servitors[/u], I gave organic sanctuaries/organic paradises a +2% robot production planetary modifier. Thus, if you have 10 organic sanctuaries on a planet, your machine pops get +20% production + the servitor morale bonus. Although this isn't an exact rebalance, it makes servitors much more viable in comparison to either regular empires or other machine empires. 
[*] I also changed two civics: [u]Constructobot[/u] was bugged to give -25% building cost (was -15%), and [u]Rapid Replicator[/u] was buffed to give +25% robot build speed (was 15%).
[*] The base cost of [u]Machine Pops[/u] was changed to 75 minerals and 25 energy, which will make machine empires more viable early on. (vanilla base cost is 100 minerals flat)
[/list]
Note: the changes to authorities and civics here are based upon my Ethic and Government overhaul mod.

[u]Robot Workers[/u] 
Build Cost: 80 minerals and 40 energy. (vanilla 100 minerals flat)

[h1]Robot and Machine Empire Traits Overhaul[/h1]
[u]Power Drills[/u]: mineral production bonus increased to 15% (was 10%)

[u]Harvesters[/u]: food production bonus increased to 15% (was 10%)

[u]Superconductive[/u]: energy production bonus increased to 15% (was 10%

[u]Efficency Processor[/u]: robot upkeep reduction bonus increased to -25% (was -10%)

[u]Logic Engines[/u]: only allowed on synth and machine units (removed droids). 

[u]Propaganda Machines[/u]: instead of giving a % based unity bonus, a synth unit (the trait was changed to synth only) with this trait adds a flat +1 unity to whichever tile it is occupying. 

[u]Control Harness[/u]: added a new trait that can be added only to Synths. This trait costs 3 points and is the robotic equivalent of Nerve Stapled- a synth unit with this trait is not affected by happiness at all. It has -40% research and unity production and -10% energy production, as well as 50% more upkeep costs. 

[h1]Changes to Technologies[/h1]
[list]
[*]Synth Workers will now have its normal drop chance for spiritualist empires
[/list]

[h1]Changes to the AI Policy[/h1]
[u][b]The AI Policy was changed so Spiritualist empires can have both synth servitude and give synths full-rights.[/b][/u] The AI weights were adjust so that spiritualist AI empires will always have either banned AI or AI servitude (favoring the latter), and never full AI rights - but players can do as they will. The reprecussion of giving synths full rights will be dealing with the fact that doing so incur -25% global spiritualist ethics attraction due to the AI rights policy itself (vanilla definitions) and the materialst ethics attraction of synth pops, as well as the an unhappy spiritualist faction. With this change in mind, I rebalanced the materialist and spiritualist ethic attractions. Please note that these changes are based upon my Ethic and Government overhaul mod. 

[h1]Changes to Ethics Attraction[/h1]
[u]Materialist Attractions[/u]
[list]
The materialist ethic attraction of Synth pops was reduced from +100% to +25% (note the governing ethics attraction added to these pops as well, which is meant to balance this out a bit). 
The materialist ethic attraction of Cybernetic pops was reduced from +50% to +25%
The materialist ethic attraction of organic pops resulting from the presence of a robotic pop on planet was reduced from +50% to +25%.
The militarist ethic attraction of pops with one of the natral scientist traits (e.g. Natral Sociologists) was removed. 
The attraction of the materialist faction (i.e. the "technologist" faction) for robotic pops was reduced from +100% to +25%.
[/list]

[u]Spiritualist Attractions[/u]
[list]
The spiritualist ethic attraction caused by having the ascension perks mind over matter and transcendence was removed.
The spiritualist ethic attraction caused by having the technology Psionic Theory was removed.
Added +25% spiritualist attraction to any pop that has either the latent psionic or psionic traits.
The spiritualist faction (i.e. the "traditionalist" faction) was changed so it no longer wants robots to be banned. If A.I policy is set to servitude this faction will not have any happiness penalties.
