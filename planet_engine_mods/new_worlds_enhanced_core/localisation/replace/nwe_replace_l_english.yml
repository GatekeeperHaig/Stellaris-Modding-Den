 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Also known as Jovian planets, these are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen. Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600kph. These planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "These worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a habitable planet. The core and crust are completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and composed of hydrogen and helium. As the planet cools, the core and crust begin to harden and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Desolate World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Though similar in appearance to Desert worlds, these desolate worlds lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts. Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, but more complex life never evolves."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have cold, barren surfaces and no atmosphere. While remaining highly unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets are often rich in minerals and suitable for mining."
 pc_toxic:0 "Toxic World"
 pc_toxic_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 
 pc_desert:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, arid planets with less than 20% of the surface covered in water, are considered Desert. Though many of these worlds are very hot and sandy, these are not requisite for desert classification. In fact, desert worlds may be both cold and rocky. Though precipitation is rate, drought-resistant planets and animals are common here."
 pc_arid:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_continental:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_tropical:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_ocean:0 "Oceanic World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_arctic:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_alpine:0 "Terrestrial World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Oceanic World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
 pc_gaia:0 "Gaia World"
 pc_gaia_desc:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes."
 pc_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere that may have had a different class in its recent past. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life."
 
 pc_b_star:0 "Blue Giant"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_a_star:0 "White Star"
 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_f_star:0 "White Dwarf"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star. A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool."
 pc_g_star:0 "Yellow Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, K, G and F type stars actually range in color from white to slightly orange. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than Red stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a yellow star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Yellow Giant"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "Giant stars with intermediate temperatures (spectral class G, F, and at least some A) are called yellow giants. They are far less numerous than red giants, partly because they only form from stars with somewhat higher masses, and partly because they spend less time in that phase of their lives."
 pc_m_star:0 "Red Dwarf"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_t_star:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 pc_t_star_desc:0 "Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life."
 pc_m_giant_star:0 "Red Giant"
 pc_m_giant_star_desc:0 "With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits."
