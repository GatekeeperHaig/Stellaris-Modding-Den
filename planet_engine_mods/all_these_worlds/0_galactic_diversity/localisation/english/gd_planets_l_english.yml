 pc_cold_reducing:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_cold_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_volcanic:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_volcanic_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system.

 pc_radiated:0 "Scorched World"
 pc_radiated_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable irradiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres (if any) are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450 degrees Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200 degrees Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on these worlds."
 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period.
