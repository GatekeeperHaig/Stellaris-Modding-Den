 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Also known as Jovian planets, these are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen. Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600kph. These planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Geoinactive world."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Desolate World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Though similar in appearance to Desert worlds, these desolate worlds lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts. Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, but more complex life never evolves."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "When all volcanic activity on a Volcanic world ceases, the planet is then considered Geologically inactive. Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have cold, barren surfaces and no atmosphere. While remaining highly unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets are often rich in minerals and suitable for mining."
 pc_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, arid planets with less than 20% of the surface covered in water, are considered Desert. Though many of these worlds are very hot and sandy, these are not requisite for desert classification. In fact, desert worlds may be both cold and rocky. Though precipitation is rate, drought-resistant planets and animals are common here."
 pc_arid:0 "Arid World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Tundra World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_continental:0 "Continental World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_ocean:0 "Pelagic World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_arctic:0 "Arctic World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_alpine:0 "Alpine World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Savanna World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
 pc_toxic:0 "Toxic World"
 pc_toxic_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life."
 pc_gaia:0 "Gaia World"
 pc_gaia_desc:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 pc_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere that may have had a different class in its recent past. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life."

 pc_large_asteroid_moon:0 "Large orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_small_asteroid_moon:0 "Small orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_greenhouse_hot:0 "Hot Reducing World"
 pc_greenhouse_hot_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures." 
 pc_greenhouse_cold:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_greenhouse_cold_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface." 
 pc_gas_giant_hot:0 "Ultra Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_hot_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. These planets form on the fringe of a star system."
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid:0 "Dwarf Planetoid"
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid_desc:0 "A planetoid is a tiny world that generally does not meet the criteria for a planet, this includes moons, asteroids, and small planet-like objects. Dwarf planetoids can be composed of rock or ice, many are not even spherical, and have eccentric orbits cluttered with various even smaller objects."
 pc_marginal:0 "Warm Marginal World"
 pc_marginal_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", are generally similar to Terrestrial planets, but on a larger scale and with smaller water coverege. The Warm sub-class tends to be rocky and forested, and while they are suitable for life, the scarce water supply makes natural evolution more difficult."
 pc_irradiated_marginal:0 "Irradiated Marginal World"
 pc_irradiated_marginal_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect them from their star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid bodies of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist under water."
 pc_marginal_cold:0 "Cold Marginal World"
 pc_marginal_cold_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", are generally similar to Terrestrial planets, but on a larger scale and with smaller water coverege. The Cold sub-class tends to be frigid and rocky, with large bodies of frozen water, except in lower latitudes where liquid water and vegetation can be found."
 pc_geometallic:0 "Primordial World"
 pc_geometallic_desc:0 "As a Molten world cools, the crust and core solidify and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right. These barren worlds are witness to much geologic activity, steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water and forms the first shallow seas, in which bacteria may develop and ultimately thrive. As the core of a Primordial planet cools, the volcanic activity lessens and the planet eventually transitions to a more inhabitable class."
 pc_geocrystalline:0 "Cambrian World"
 pc_geocrystalline_desc:0 "After the core of a Primordial planet is sufficiently cool, volcanic activity lessens and conditions for life improve. Oxygen and Nitrogen are present in some abundance in the atmosphere, giving rise to increasingly complex organisms such as primitive vegetation like algae, and animal akin to sponges and jellyfish. As the planet continues to cool, it can finally transition into the final stage of its evolution." 
 pc_geomorteus:0 "Radiated World"
 pc_geomorteus_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable radiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450º Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200º Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on Radiated worlds."
 pc_geoplastic:0 "Molten World"
 pc_geoplastic_desc:0 "These worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a habitable planet. The core and crust are completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and composed of hydrogen and helium. As the planet cools, the core and crust begin to harden and the planet can become Primordial if conditions are right."
 pc_lush:0 "Lush World"
 pc_lush_desc:0 "These lush worlds have a temperate climate with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Climate variation is very low, resulting in lush terrain dominating its land masses which are separated by mostly shallow seas. Cold and dry climates are only found near the poles and mountain tops, while deserts are usually non-existent as precepitation levels are similar in every latitude. This planet type can be considered perfect for any species that evolved in temperate worlds." 
 pc_retinal:0 "Retinal World"
 pc_retinal_desc:0 "These unusual purple worlds usually have temperate and humid climates, displaying dense vegetation that uses retinal instead of chlorophyll, possibly a result of having evolved around a star with low luminosity or as a gas-giant moon. Most Retinal worlds are tidally locked, but increased volcanic activity helps to keep conditions stable due to greenhouse effects." 
 pc_irradiated_terrestrial:0 "Irradiated Terrestrial World"
 pc_irradiated_terrestrial_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist."
