Viewed from afar, the trees take the form of tree-trunks, spreading slightly near their base in a fashion that suggests a connection to unpreserved root-like structures. Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grows sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the "trunks" represent the fruiting body, or "sporophore", of a fungus, which would be fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed hyphae filaments."

They are easily attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, and they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations almost immediately. This seems to be an effort to defend their territory, of which they seem to be highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, might be a rarity in itself. The sandworms are extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sense each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. Despite all the potential danger, the spice must flow."

 Artificial_Core:0 "Artificial Core"

They are covered in a thick, mostly brown fur to keep them warm during the nights. They seem to be a very social type of animal. It's not known how, but they seem to take the same route around the world looking for food every season. Perhaps they're just good at remembering the terrain they roam."

 Carnivorous_Flies:0 "Carnivorous Flies"
 Carnivorous_Flies_desc:0 "These tiny flies may seem like just an annoyance, they are the most dangerous creatures on this world. These tiny flies glow in the dark at night, but that's not when they're out feeding. During the night they glow as a means to attract other carnivorous flies as a part of their mating ritual, which seems to be quite complex. During the day they fly around looking for food.\nBeing carnivorous, they tend to swarm their prey and eat it alive in a matter of hours. Large, or small, all creatures are food for them. What makes it even worse is their colony like behaviour, allowing them to navigate complex tunnels.. or vents! The fact that they emit no noise to even warn their next meal is the worst part."

 # 144
 Ocean_Trenches:1 "Extreme Ocean Trenches"
 Ocean_Trenches_desc:1 "The unfathomable deep trenches of the ocean floor on this world will probably never be fully explored.
