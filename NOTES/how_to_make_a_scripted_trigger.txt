#writing a scripted_trigger is very easy

#1. choose a name for your trigger and write it like this
#2. the open brackets can perform trigger checks. You can use all operators - AND/OR/NOR/NOT/NAND/IF and all triggers. 
#3. in this example, add the planet classes.

#example:

name_of_trigger = {
	OR = {
		is_planet_class = pc_
		is_planet_class = pc_
		is_planet_class = pc_
	}
}
