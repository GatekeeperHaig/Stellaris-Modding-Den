###### design document, Ex Traits and Ascensions rework

The base vanilla ascension, i.e. biological, psionic and synthethic ascensions are being reworked into 4 different ascension paths:

1. biological ascension, focusing on "pure" genetic engineering
2. cybernetic ascension, focusing on the interfacing of biological lifeforms with cybernetic and bionic machinary
3. synthethic ascension, focusing on the development of "mindware" and robotic drones.
4. psionic ascension, focusing on the unlocking of deep telepathic powers.

----

hive-mind empires can go for any 1 and 4.
machine intellgience empires can only go with 3, which allows them to "convert" regular pops. 
biological empires can go for all 4 - which are of course mutually exclusive.

The requirement



1. telepathy is a base trait that can be added to species on species creation, and it scaled from rudimentary telepathy (telepathic_1) to transcendent level power (telepathic_2)
2. cybernetic is also a base trait that can be choosen upon

Unlike vanilla in this mod each "archetype", i.e. robotic, machine, and biological, can go for different as
