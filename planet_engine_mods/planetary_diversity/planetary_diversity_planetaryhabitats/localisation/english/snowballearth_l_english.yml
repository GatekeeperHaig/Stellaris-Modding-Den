 #Custom tooltips
 frozen_wasteland_clearing_effect:0 "Thawing the ice in this region will lower the ammount of reflected sun-light, resulting in more heat absortion leading to increased temperature and habitability."
 snowball_frozen_wasteland_effect:0 "The freezing temperatures lower habitability significantly."
 snowball_recovering_biosphere_effect:0 "Temperatures are still low, with reduced habitability, but not as much as before."
