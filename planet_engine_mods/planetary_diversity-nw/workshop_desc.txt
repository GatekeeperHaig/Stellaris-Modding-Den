Compatible with Stellaris 2.7.

A sub-mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url], do not use without it, it needs to overwrite a small number of PD's files, so it should be placed below Planetary Diversity in your mod list.

These are the main features:
[list]
[*]Adds a large number of new planets, both inhabitable and uninhabitable, with custom new textures.
[*]A script runs after game-start, to convert vanilla planets and resources, your game may seem to freeze, but this is normal and will only happen once per game.
[*]The Sol system has been updated to use some of the new planet classes, as well as updated textures for several planets, my version overwrites Planetary Diversity's and you can choose to make both Venus and Titan terraforming candidates, while Luna and Europa are candidates for underground colonization which is a new feature of this mod.

All new planet textures and icons are original works and cannot be used without permission, while the other graphics may be recolors of Stellaris original assets.

This mod's new worlds would not be possible without Chris Adamek's contribution with his excellent texture-making! The mod is loosely based on his Star Trek Planet Classification Guide, adapted to better fit Stellaris. All textures are his original works, done specifically for this mod and for any other use he wishes to give them in the future. If you like his work and anything related to star trek, be sure to check out his website which also includes some fine fiction:

Or his new website related to his original fiction, first book available on Amazon:
