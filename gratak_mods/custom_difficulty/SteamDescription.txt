Ever had the problem that early game was way to hard and either you die early, or the game becomes boring very soon afterwards? Or do you think the game is too hard/easy in general and the player would deserve some bonuses/penalties? Or do you want stronger Fallen Empires. Or you want to reduce resource overflow in late game? The crisis or Great Khan is a lackluster or ruining your game? Or, or, or...

Then this mod is for you!

[h1]Compatible Versions[/h1]
Updated to Stellaris 3.0. This mod DOES STILL work with 2.2.-2.8 (just ignore the warning). It also now has the right loading order with regard to the "More Modifier" Addon automatically, both with old and new launcher.

[h1]Extensions[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613880809]More Modifier Extension/Standalone[/url]: If you think that some modifier is missing in the difficulty setting, try this mod and I'm pretty sure you'll find it there. It's a bit simpler and without scaling for performance reasons (it really has a lot of modifiers)

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1809087738]Hemothep's Dynamic Difficulty[/url] can be used on top of this mod (and the More Modifier extension). It automatically applies bonuses to the AI if the player grows too strong. These bonuses are in addition to any other difficulty buffs that are otherwise applied, whether from my mod(s) or vanilla.

[h1]Features[/h1]
1. Choosing any of the Vanilla pre-defined difficulties in mid-game. Mod can even be installed mid-game.
2. "Scaling" difficulty can be combined with other predefined difficulties (added on top).
3. Is fully customizeable. You can change 10 different types of bonuses in 7 empire categories (AI, Player, FE+AE, Leviathans, Crisis, Marauders, Other) to a precision of 1% (10% for player) and in a huge range: -127% to + 1023% for AI, -100% to 200% for player and -75% to 1,309,440% (yeah, that's crazy) for crisis.
4. Allows locking of the customized difficulty for MP (Troll prevention) or other reasons. Unlock via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1354362281]sub-mod[/url].
5. Moved "Diplomatic Influence Upkeep reduction" from a bonus every AI gets to scale with difficulty and be customizeable.
6. Can set a difficulty randomness in the options of the mod: At the start of the game (or after one day in a running game) each AI empire rolls a dice. Depending on that roll, its bonuses are decreased up to the maximum given in the options. Bonuses/Maluses can even invert if more than 100% maximum randomness is chosen. If used, I advice to increase the base difficulty a bit, since this will reduce it in total (but might create a monster than devours weaker AI neighbors).

[h1]Scaling[/h1]
In contrast to vanilla, scaling is independent of the difficulty you select. If you select a difficulty, that one is always instantly applied. Scaling gives a yearly increase on top. You can fine tune it in the customization. By default, there is a 1% step every four years.

[h1]IMPORTANT[/h1]
Main menu can be opened via:
- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1087781345]Mod Menu[/url]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458024521]Dynamic Mod Menu 3.0[/url]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1943060017]Infinite Stellaris ModMenu[/url]
- Country Edict

[h1]Performance[/h1]
If you should have problems with lags at the start of each year, you can activate a delay mode in the options that let's the country updates of modifiers have a random delay, spreading the computations over half a Stellaris year.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Can be added into a running game. You need to wait 1 day in this case before being able to open the menu.
- Can be uninstalled during a game (resetting to difficulty set when starting the game). Simply removing the mod will leave over "?" modifiers (who won't do anything), but there is an "uninstall" option in the Menu. Should you afterwards want to install the mod again in the same save-game, this will only work via console: "event custom_difficulty.20".
- Should have very few conflicts with other mods (yes, compatible with Glavius and Starnet. Also no problem with multi-crisis mods). Only overwrites vanilla difficulty settings. If a mod adds new country types (like a new crisis) they would fall in the "Other" category. New races and predefined empires will always be "AI" without a problem (checking for "default" country).
- Created for Stellaris 2.2 and later. There is a separate legacy mod for 2.1.* (which works mostly with 2.0.1 as well)
- (Obviously) Not Achievement compatible.

[h1]Localization[/h1]
- "pt","en","fr", "de","pl","ru", "es" language files given but all mostly English. Most modifier and difficulty names are links to the Vanilla localization. 

[h1]Options[/h1]
- Choose between simple and custom (default) mode. Simple mode only changes modifiers in three categories. Thus much less modifiers are needed which improves the performance even more. Switching between the two works without losing any previously done settings. Switching to simple will use the value of the first bonus (Minerals, Research, Weapon damage) as group bonus. When changing the group, values for all entries are still changed while in simple mod.
- Player Vassal Bonuses: Choose between giving them the same bonus as the player (default) or the AI bonuses.
- Delay Mode: Changed Modifier changes are either applied whenever closing the menu and at the start of each year (default) or 1-181 afterwards.
