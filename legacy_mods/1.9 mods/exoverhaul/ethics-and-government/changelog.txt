[h1]Major Ethic Reconfiguations[/h1]
The AI Policy was changed so Spiritualist empires can have both synth servitude and give synths full-rights. The AI weights were adjust so that spiritualist AI empires will always have either banned AI or AI servitude (favoring the latter), and never full AI rights - but players can do as they will. The reprecussion of giving synths full rights will be dealing with the fact that doing so incur -25% global spiritualist ethics attraction due to the AI rights policy itself (vanilla definitions) and the materialst ethics attraction of synth pops, as well as the an unhappy spiritualist faction. Following this logic, I reconfigured [u]ethic attractions[/u] and [u]faction attractions[u].

[u]Materialist Attractions[/u]
[list]
The materialist ethic attraction of Synth pops was reduced from +100% to +25% (note the governing ethics attraction added to these pops as well, which is meant to balance this out a bit). 
The materialist ethic attraction of Cybernetic pops was reduced from +50% to +25%
The materialist ethic attraction of organic pops resulting from the presence of a robotic pop on planet was reduced from +50% to +25%.
The militarist ethic attraction of pops with one of the natral scientist traits (e.g. Natral Sociologists) was removed. 
The attraction of the materialist faction (i.e. the "technologist" faction) for robotic pops was reduced from +100% to +25%.
[/list]

[u]Spiritualist Attractions[/u]
[list]
The spiritualist ethic attraction caused by having the ascension perks mind over matter and transcendence was removed.
The spiritualist ethic attraction caused by having the technology Psionic Theory was removed.
Added +25% spiritualist attraction to any pop that has either the latent psionic or psionic traits.
The spiritualist faction (i.e. the "traditionalist" faction) was changed so it no longer wants robots to be banned. If A.I policy is set to servitude this faction will not have any happiness penalties.
[/list]

[u]Miltarist Attraction[/u]
[list]
The militarist ethic attraction of pops with either the Strong or Very Strong traits was removed. 
Militarist faction (i.e. the "imperialist" faction) changed so it no longer has a problem with joining a federation. Instead, if you do not conquer anyone for an extended period the militarist faction will be unhappy.
[/list]

[u]Xenophobe Attraction[/u]
[list]
The "isolationist" xenophobe faction now really hates it when you join a federation, which only makes sense. 
Militaristic ethic pops are more likely to join the "supremacist" xenophobe faction, having a +10% chance of doing so (they have a -75% chance of joining the isolationist faction).
[/list]

[u]Authoritarian Attractions[/u]
[list]
The negative Authoritarian ethic attraction of enslaved pops was reduced from -75% to -50%.
[/list]

[u]Egalitarian Attractions[/u]
[list]
The egalitarian attraction of enslaved pops was reduced from +300% to +100%. 
The egalitarian attraction of non-enslaved pops on a planet were there are some enslaved pops was reduced from +50% to +25%. 
The egalitarian attraction of pops with utopian living standard was raised from +50% to +150%. 
The egalitarian attraction of pops with welfare living standard was reduced from +50% to +25%.
