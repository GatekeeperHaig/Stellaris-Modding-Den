#Troglobities are hyper adapted to their specific cave systems having issues even in other cave systems. To simulate this, they colonize worlds by expanding and semi-terraforming them. This adds a habitability bonus representing how well they live but slows the colonization process. Building in a cave world isnâ€™t easy. Any wrong move and the ceiling comes crashing down on everyone. This leads to sturdy bomb shelter like supports but all buildings on the planet are costlier and slower to build. Warfare in tight twisty caves is difficult so they gain higher disengagement.
