## OCEANIC planets are characterized by having a world-wide ocean, with different classes having different sea-levels / percentage of surface land / frozen surface

## Archipelagic - the vanilla Ocean world, deep ocean with dispersed archipelagos. High percentage of temperate waters suitable for aquatic species, lower percentage of tropical lands for surface species.

## Panthalassic - a submerged world with no surface land, or an insignificant number of small islands. High percentage of temperate waters suitable for aquatic species.
## replaces pc_alpine in the 00_planet_classes file

## Pangaian - an oceanic world with lower sea-level, leaves a large surface land-mass. Split percentage of temperate waters and surface land with temperate and dry biomes.
## replaces pc_savannah in the 00_planet classes file

## Cryothalassic - a cold oceanic world with frozen surface with cold waters beneath, kept in a liquid state due to geothermal activity or tidal heating.
