 # Uninhabitable Planets/bodies
 
 pc_orbiting_asteroid:0 "Orbiting Asteroid"
 pc_orbiting_asteroid_desc:0 "Possibly an asteroid that was captured by this planet's gravity.\n\n"
 pc_hot_reducing:0 "Hot Reducing World"
 pc_hot_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures."
 pc_cold_reducing:0 "Cold Reducing World"
 pc_cold_reducing_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_volcanic:0 "Volcanic World"
 pc_volcanic_desc:0 "Generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps temperatures very hot, regardless of the planet's location in a star system. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet "dies" and becomes a Geoinactive world."
 pc_radiated:0 "Scorched World"
 pc_radiated_desc:0 "Small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, these planets have highly unstable irradiated surfaces. The thin atmospheres (if any) are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450 degrees Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200 degrees Celsius at night. No life forms have ever been observed on Radiated worlds."
 pc_dwarf_planetoid:0 "Dwarf Planetoid"
 pc_dwarf_planetoid_desc:0 "A planetoid is a tiny world that generally does not meet the criteria for a planet, this includes moons, asteroids, and small planet-like objects. Dwarf planetoids can be composed of rock or ice, many are not even spherical, and have eccentric orbits cluttered with various even smaller objects."
 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. These planets form on the fringe of a star system."

 # Habitable Planets - New Worlds Originals
 
 pc_primordial:0 "Primordial World"
