[h1]Performance[/h1]
I have strongly improved performance. TLTR: About 26 times faster than the beta.
Only modifiers that actually change are removed and applied.
I tried a test of doing 25 yearly updates on my laptop in a row with Huge Galaxy, 30 AIs, 5 FEs, 3 Marauders and standard scaling (thus changing modifiers every 4 updates).
The beta took 26 seconds for this, the final version about 1 second (Stellaris log isn't more precise than that). 
If you still should have problems, you can activate a delay mode in the options 
that let's the country updates on modifiers have a random delay, spreading the computations over half a Stellaris year.
