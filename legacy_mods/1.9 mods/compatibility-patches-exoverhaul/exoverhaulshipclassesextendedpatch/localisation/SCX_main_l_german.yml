 SCX_NOVA_REACTOR_EMPTY: "Empty Slot"
 SCX_NOVA_REACTOR_1: "Titan Reactor"
 SCX_NOVA_REACTOR_1_DESC: "This massive power core and its multiple layers of containment take up an entire deck of a Superdreadnought-sized vessel. It was designed specifically to supply power to the Titan Lance."
 scx_nova_reactor: "Titan Reactor"
 scx_nova_reactor_DESC: "This massive power core and its multiple layers of containment take up an entire deck of a Superdreadnought-sized vessel. It was designed specifically to supply power to the Titan Lance."
 
 SCX_NOVA_CANNON_1: "Thalaron Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_1: "Thalaron Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_1_DESC: "This weapon delivers a form of tertiary EM band electromagnetic radiation via a concentrated energy beam. Its primary purpose is actually not to destroy ships, but rather to kill their crew. Ship destruction is merely an unavoidable side effect."
 SCX_NOVA_CANNON_2: "Tachyon Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_2: "Tachyon Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_2_DESC: "An improvement upon the much smaller weapon of mass destruction it was derived from, the Titan Tachyon Lance operates on very much the same principles but at a much higher capacity. It owes its existence solely to staunch disbelief in the concept of overkill."
 SCX_NOVA_CANNON_3: "Thanix Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_3: "Thanix Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_3_DESC: "Commonly mistaken for a particle beam, it is in fact a stream of liquid iron, uranium and tungsten alloy, channeled continously along an electromagnetic tunnel by a powerful mass accelerator. Not that anyone on the receiving end would appreciate the distinction."
 SCX_NOVA_CANNON_4: "Yamato Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_4: "Yamato Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_4_DESC: "This weapon directly harnesses the main reactor's raw power output by focusing a controlled explosion into a cohesive beam of energy and venting the resulting plasma discharge straight at the target. The unbelievable simplicy of it is equal parts ingenious and disturbing."
 SCX_NOVA_CANNON_5: "Warp Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_5: "Warp Titan Lance"
 scx_nova_cannon_5_DESC: "By projecting highly unstable warp fields, this weapon creates a localised space-time anomaly at the point of impact. Asymmetricaly and rapidly shifting mass disrupts molecular cohesion, causing the target to rip itself apart. Which is generally considered a bad thing."
