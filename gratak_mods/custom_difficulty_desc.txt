I have strongly improved performance.
Only modifiers that actually change are removed and applied.
I tried a test of doing 25 yearly updates in a row with Huge Galaxy, 30 AIs, 5 FEs, 3 Marauders and standard scaling (thus changing modifiers every 4 updates).
The beta took about 20 seconds for this, the final version about 1 second. 
If you still should have problems, you can activate a delay mode in the options 
that let's the country updates on modifiers have a random delay.
