### Entries Below replace Vanlla Localizations - they use the vanilla keys. New components are implemented in /english

 SHIP_SENSOR_1:0 "Quantum Optical Radar"
 SHIP_SENSOR_1_DESC:0 "This radar system offers rudimentary FTL radar capabilities, allowing us to monitor our immediate stellar enviornment."
 SHIP_SENSOR_2:0 "Gravitic Pulse Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_2_DESC:0 "This complex system uses minute gravity pulses to map a larger volume of space."
 SHIP_SENSOR_3:0 "Tachyon Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_3_DESC:0 "Advanced sensors that rely on rotating tachyon beams capable of detecting ship movements across interstellar distances."
 SHIP_SENSOR_4:0 "Subspace Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_4_DESC:0 "Sensors that detect the subspace fluctuations left in the wake of traveling starships. Their sensitivity and range is even greater than that of tachyon sensors."
 SHIP_SENSOR_5:0 "Hyperprobe Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_5_DESC:0 "These sensors simultaneously map subspace and hyperspace, allowing us to monitor an incredible volume of space at once."
