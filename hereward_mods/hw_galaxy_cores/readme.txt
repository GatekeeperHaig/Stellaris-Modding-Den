HW: Mod - Galaxy Cores

Version: 1.2

This mod adds a core of stars to the cores of elliptical and spiral galaxies,
and adds a sparse few stars to the void of ring galaxies. A passage may, or may
not, be found to the other side of a ring galaxy.

All other galaxy settings are kept as vanilla.



Enjoy,

Hereward
