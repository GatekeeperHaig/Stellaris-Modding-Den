HW: Species - Pharaonic Malignity

Version: 2.2

Their homeworld an industrial wasteland, after generations of exploitation and
rampant pollution, the Pharaonic Malignity are now looking for other worlds to
colonise, or conquer.

Their homeworld is nearly depleted of coal, oil and gas and their atmosphere is
all but destroyed. This is the way of things and they will find new worlds to
consume. If the new worlds are already colonised they will lose themselves
into the sea of people and infiltrate the worlds elite. When they have the
power to rule they will oppress the people and send their mighty fleets to
subjugate them, lost and without hope.

They are an ancient people, productively and economically astute. They channel
their output towards military production and can tender large fleets. Before
using their fleets, however, they will employ tactics of influence and
diplomacy to acquire their goals.


Requires
* HW: Mod - Wasteland World


A long time ago in a game far, far away....
This is a reworking of a species from a pack I originally developed for
Galactic Civilizations (which only works in Windows). Having converted to Linux
I am so pleased to discover Stellaris.

* Naeb Aggregation - A peaceful aquatic race driven by the necessity to adapt
and colonise other worlds as their aged homeworld slowly cools and freezes.

* Pharaonic Malignity - Having heavily polluted their homeworld with the
consumption of hydrocarbon fuels the Pharaonic Malignity are now looking for
other worlds to colonise, or conquer.

* Rwaddi Shrewdness - The Rwaddi are a race of arboreal primates who are more
at home on their jungle world than they are at spacefaring.

* Stratus Urbanites - The Stratus live on an arid world with twin moons. Their
homeworld draws tourist from afar to view their amazing cities and the romantic
views of moons.


Enjoy,

Hereward
