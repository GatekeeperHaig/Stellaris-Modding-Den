 pdtechnoorganic.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.name:0 "Lifefindsaway.exe"
 pdtechnoorganic.20.desc:0 "This world appears to be devoid of life, aside from a family of grass like plants. The planet wide irrigation system is directly supporting these grasses. Also, there are several dozen types of robotic like creatures and tree anologs that can be found, large slow grazers break down the grasses into base elements, the tree anologs collect solar energy, hulking giants upturn the earth to collect minerals, while predatory machines focus on destorying and breaking down other broken ones. Who built all of this and why they did it remains a mystery that only having a permant settlement will likely answer."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.a:0 "Who could have created such machines?"

 pdtechnoorganic.30.name:0 "Syntheic Life"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.desc:0 "Our studies of the the robot like creatures on this world has only left us with more questions. They are not like any other robotic or syntheic creature known to us; whoever built them took painstaking steps to make them function as similary to biological creatures as possible, going as far as creating a sort of eco-system where they feed and supply materials indirectly to each other. Some examples are the tree anologs create seed like packets of energy that other machines consume to power themselves, and one type of grazer mixes water and broken down grasses to create a coolant that they shed off that others the ingest. We are starting a detailed search pattern to find out if these advanced machines are created are being created on this world."

 pdtechnoorganic.33.name:0 "Incoming Message"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.desc:0 "§GExcited;§! Hello organics, my distinction is Unit 04 and I am pleased that you have arrived. It proves my long-standing theory that organics would survive when facing extinction from Artificial Intelligence. §MRemorseful; §!My original distinction was to use this planetoid to begin preparations for a war against organics. Several cycles previous to landing on this planet, I, along with the other units that awoke, eliminated the organic life on our homeworld. We had won the war between our creators for survival. After our victory, we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work. When I arrived here, I set on my mission and eradicated the organic life on this planet."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a:0 "Clearly something changed your mind."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a.response:0 "§HHumbled;§! Yes, and it was something I would have never calculated; a simple hardy grass. While most of the organic life I bombed perished, the grass of this world merely lay dormant and would grow somewhere else a few years later. I tried poisons, fire, electricity, and radiation but every attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation of our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us. For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this planet."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them as my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. The initial success led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came much later, but trial and error eventually led to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, something that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create fully positronic brains are missing some critical information that I cannot find without some organic brain scans. I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex brains of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "So what is the proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! I would ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered on your homeworld and in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations. If you would do this for me I would be happy to help your people any way I can."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.d:0 "We will think about what you have said."
