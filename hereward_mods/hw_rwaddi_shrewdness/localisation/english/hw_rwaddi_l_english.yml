 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hw_rwaddi_desc:0 "The Rwaddi Shrewdness are a race of arboreal primates more at home on their jungle world of Juelow than they are at spacefaring.\n\nRwaddi society is highly organised around the family, the tribe. All adults are responsible for the care of the young and the young have the freedom to explore and learn at will. Consequently the Rwaddi have no concept of schooling as their young learn all they need from the wider community. When a young Rwaddi reaches adolescence they know from what has inspired them during childhood, what path to take as an adult. Though the individual may lack certain knowledge, each generation as a whole continues to grow in strength of wisdom, passing on to the next generation a growing wealth."
