What does this mod do? 
[list]
1. It overhauls almost all of the vanilla organic, robotic and machine species traits, changing their bonuses, costs, and at times renaming and reconceptualizing them. 
2. It overhauls almost all of the vanilla leader traits. 
3. It adds a new cybernetic trait that is unlocked through tech for organic empires (including hive-minds), 1 new robotic trait, and 3 new leader traits.
[/list]

IMPORTANT NOTE: This mod also contains a limited version of my overhaul of robots and machine traits without the overhaul of the basic robotic/machine traits (i.e. the "Robot", "Android", "Synth", "Machine" and "Mechanical" traits) . I include this limited version of the robotic/machine trait overhaul in this mod as well because it is necessary for the overall game balance. I nonetheless recommend installing my Robots and Machine overhaul mod if you are interested in the full functionality of that mod and its changes to robotic/machine gameplay and balance. I also highly suggest running my Ethic and Government overhaul mod, which removes the synths/psionics dichotomy and reworks materialists and spiritualists. 

Compatibility: This mod is [u]compatible[/u] with the Extended Traits mod. It is incompatible with any mod that overwrites the vanilla trait files. This mod is savegame compatibile.

[h1]Cybernetic Trait[/h1]

The [u]vanilla Cybernetic trait[/u], which is used in the synth ascension path (the Flash is Weak project) and for Driven Assimilator pops, was renamed "Cybertronic Interface." This was a deep change I made in all the relevant localisation files throughout the game - reimagining the vanilla cybernatics as cybertronics. I also rebalanced this trait: the army damage bonus was removed. The leader age bonus was reduced to +20 (was +40), and I added +5% energy production and +25% army health bonus.

This change was done in order to free a place for new cybernetic traits. It always bothered me that in this sci-fi game cybernetics are so limited and appear so late. This is one of those sci-fi tropes that needs a much greater presence. I therefore introduced three new traits - "Rudimentary Cyborg", "Advanced Cyborg" and "Superior Cyborg". These traits unlock through technologies that are available to all organic empires, including spiritualists and hive-minds. First tech is tier 2 level 2, second tech is tier 3 level 1 and third tech is tier 3 level 4. This is what these traits do:

[u]Cybernetic:[/u] cost = 1. Has -15% pop growth, +20% leader influence cost and +10% consumer goods cost [u]penalties.[/u] Has +5% all resource production, +10 years leader lifespan, +10% leader experience gain and +10% habitability. Placing this trait on a species will result in a change to all leaders of this species who will receive the "Rudimentary Cyborg" leader trait.  

[u][b]Cybernetic Leader Traits[/b][/u]

[u]Scientist:[/u] -10%  anomaly fail risk.

[u]Governor:[/u] +15% building build speed. 

[u]General:[/u] +15%  army health. 

[u]Admiral:[/u] +5%/+5% tracking/evasion 

[u]Ruler:[/u] -15% penalties due to distance from homeworld.
