[h1] Gaia Planets Enhanced [/h1] 

All Gaia planets get a special modifier called "Gaia World", which gives  +50% migration attraction / +20% pop growth / +15% border range and the planet itself generates +10 unity. 

[h1] Ringworlds Enhanced [/h1]

All Ringworlds get a special planetary modifier. This modifier gives: +20% migration attraction, -20% building maintenance, +15% border extrusion. In addition, each inhabited ringworld segment produces +10 unity.

[h1] Tomb Worlds Enhanced [/h1] 

This mod adds two unique modifiers for tomb worlds: Psychic Residue and Necropolis. Both modifiers have a small-medium negative effect, and a large positive effect. 

[u]Psychic Residue:[/u]
"There is a lingering psychic residue from the catastrophic event that tranformed this planet into a tomb world. While highly disconcerting, this residue appears to stimulate creative thought"
Effects are: -5% migration pull, -5% happiness, +20%/+20%/+20% engineering/society/physics tile output.

[u]Necropolis:[/u]
"The dead husks of vast alien metropolises remain in this world as painful monuments to the transcience and fragility of sentient life. On the other hand, this makes mining a much simpler task."
Effects are: -15% pop growth, +20% tile mineral output

IMPORTANT NOTES:
[list]
[*] The Gaia modifier is added to all planets terraformed to Gaia. It is also added to all gaia planets at game start, and there is also a monthly (invisible) event that checks every month if all Gaia planets have this modifier, and in case they don't adds it, therefore making sure even games not started with this mod enabled will get 100% of its functions.
[*] The Ringworld modifier is added to each Ringworld segment upon its construction. The mod also runs an event each month that makes sure all complete Ringworlds have the modifier and adds it if its missing. So if you are adding this mod to an already existing save, give it a month to make sure your Ringworlds get the modifier. 
[*] The Tomb World modifiers will not always spawn but instead have a high but nonetheless RNG based chance of appearing. There is also a monthly (invisible) event that checks to make sure these modifiers have been applied. If they have not, there is a roll for each tomb world in the galaxy. 
[/list] 

So to make sure you get these modifiers appear in your savegame, please wait for 1 month after loading - the hidden events are timed on a monthly pulse. 

[h1] New Strategic Resource + Tech + Building [/h1]

The mod adds a new planetary strategic resource called [b]Archeological Remains[/b], which always spawns in a deposit with society research. This resource can appear on any habitable planet, but it has an increased chance of appearing on Gaia worlds and especially on Tomb Worlds. You can build on this resource a special building called [b]Archeological Compound[/b], which is unlocked with a t1 tech called Xeno-Archeology (has the Xeno-Zoo tech as a prerequisite, so make sure getting that one first). The archeological compound building gives a very nice +8 society and +2 energy. 

This resource will only spawn during galaxy generation. 

Also, please note that this mod also enables Betharian Stone on tomb worlds as well - I dunno why but in Vanilla tomb is the only kind of habitable planet that can't get these. 

[h1] Terraforming Enahnced [/h1] 

[u] Removes Negative Modifiers [/u]

The terrforming process removes almost all negative modifiers from a planet (including the Abandoned Terraforming modifier). The exception to this are the modifiers Tidal Locked, High Gravity and Mineral Poor, which cannot be removed for conceptual reasons (e.g. tidal locked means this planet is locked by a gas giant's gravity field, high gravity means this planet is extremely dense.) 

[u] Terraforming Adds a Special Planet Modifier [/u]

This modifier gives a small +5% habitability / +5% border extrusion bonuses. It reflect the fact this planet's ecology and geosphere has been optimized, as well as the long term influence impact of such a monumental undertaking.
 
[u] Terraforming Increases the Number of Tiles on the Planet [/u]

The reasoning here is the creation of artificial landmasses and huge scale land reclamation as part of the terraforming process. Mechanic-wise this works thus: when terraforming a planet below 23 in size, there is a 50% it will increase in 1 tile, 40% for 2 tiles and 10% it will increase in 3 tiles. When terraforming a size 23 or 24 planet, there is an 80% chance it will increase in 1 tile, and 20% chance it will not increase in size. This function will work only the first time a planet is terraformed to prevent abuse. 

[h1]6 Unique Strategic Resources and special empire unique buildings to exploit them[/h1]
This mod adds 6 unique Strategic Resources - resources that spawn on a maximum of 1 planet per galaxy (not guranteed to have 100% spawn of all resources if galaxy is medium or below). 

-This mod is 100% savegame compatible: the mod runs an event that adds the deposits to planets, so you can use it in the middle of a savegame or in a new game. It is also 100% compatible with all other mods out there since it does not overwrite any vanilla files. 
-I would like to thank @Elowiny, who contribued most of the building assets and 1 of the resource icons used by this mod (and 2 resource names). 
-This mod synergizes with ExOverhaul: Strategic Resources, but that mod is not required for this mod to work.

This mod overhaul the vanilla strategic resource while adding 16 new resources to the game. What this mod contains?

[list]
[*] An overhaul of vanilla resources, which fixes major imbalances in the game (especially regarding machine empires and the like). As part of this overhaul 3 vanilla strategic resources were changed into planetary strategic resoures - pitharian dust, engos vapor and satrameme gas. 
[*] This mod adds 10 new global strategic resources and 6 new planetary strategic resources.
[*] This mod also adds 16 new technologies to unlock these resoures and offers a rebalance of all existing vanilla resource techs (including many bug fixes). 
[*] Finally, this mod adds 16 new buildings (some are unique to machine empires/hive minds).
