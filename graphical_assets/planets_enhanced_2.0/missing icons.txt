In the file pe_planetary_strategic_resources.xcf these icons need to be redone:

1. sr_smartmetal - recolor, best keep living metal unique. The entire theme of the resource needs to be rethought since its too repetative.
2. sr_satramene_gas - vanilla recolor
3. sr_engos_vapor - vanilla recolor
4. sr_pitharan_dust OR sr_zro_vapor (global resource!) - vanilla recolor

In the file pe_global_strategic_resources.xcf these icons need to be redone:
1. sr_helium_3? icon's visual culture is different than the others?
2. sr_impure_lythuric OR sr_terraforming_gases, one of them needs a unique icon - this isn't crucial but would be good. 
3. sr_meta_organics - icon's visual culture is different than the others. Might be best to replace it. 
4. 2 of the following 3 resource icons: sr_teldar_crystals, sr_neorite_crystals OR sr_yuranic_crystals. Only keep the best color varient.
5. sr_unstable_xerodine - current icon is of low quality?
6. sr_unrefined_illum - current icon is of low quality
7. sr_rough_hyper_diamond - current icon is of low quality?
8. sr_thullium_ore? - recolor, but nice looking. 

In the file pe_produced_global_resources.xcf these icons need to be redone:

1. sr_cut_pyronium - current icon is of low quality
2. sr_purified_cryodine - icon's visual culture is different then the others. Icon itself is good quality, so maybe not change it....

Additionally the following produced global resource icons are missing:

1. sr_refined_hyperfuels
2. sr_stable_xerodine
3. sr_teldar_crystal_matrix
4. sr_catalyzed_zro
5. sr_yuranic_crystals
