HW: Mod - Militia Edict & Garrison

Version: 1.0
Modifies: Vanilla 2.0.2

This mod;

  * adds a planetary edict, Active Militia.
  * adds a building, Garrison.
  * tweaks the planetary edicts Martial Law and Patrol Drones.

This planet's militia can provide additional security, with funding. Their local
knowledge can help protect the civilian population whilst providing support to
the armed forces.

The planetary edict Active Militia is available anytime that Martial Law is not
in force, or the Patrol Drones are not deployed.

The planetary edicts Martial Law and Patrol Drones are now only available if
there is a military presence on the planet.

The Garrison provides a basic military presence and can be upgraded to a
Stronghold.
