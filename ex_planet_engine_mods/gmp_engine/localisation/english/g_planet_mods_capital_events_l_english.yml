 # Capital Colony Events
 # Capital Event - authoritarian -> Work Camps stage 1
 gpm_colony.4100.name:1 "Protests"
 gpm_colony.4100.desc:1 "A large number of our citizens have become increasingly unhappy with our rule. Over the past few years, they have started organizing rallies and marches to demand their voices be heard. Recently, a number of these protests have spiralled out of control and resulted in riots, leaving behind significant damage to local infrastructure. We must do something about these dissidents."
 gpm_colony.4100.a:1 "Issue a directive to the local police forces to suppress these protests."
 # Capital Event - authoritarian -> Work Camps stage 2
 gpm_colony.4110.name:1 "Spiralling Out of Control"
 gpm_colony.4110.desc:1 "The directive to suppress the protests using our local forces was successful for a time, but unfortunately it didn't last. A few local politicians appear to be behind the most recent riots. They have been seen rallying their voters to go out and protest."
 gpm_colony.4110.a:1 "Make it illegal to protest without a permit."
 # Capital Event - authoritarian -> Work Camps stage 3
 gpm_colony.4120.name:1 "Jail Overpopulation"
 gpm_colony.4120.desc:1 "Recent laws against disruptive protesting have resulted in our jails becoming overpopulated. To maintain order, a new solution must be explored. The laws have had a positive effect, however; peace and order has returned to our capital. We would like to look into alternative means of punishment that would simultaneously solve the increasing cost of punishment as well as the issue of appropriate punishment."
 gpm_colony.4120.a:1 "Alright, find me a solution."
 # Capital Event - authoritarian -> Work Camps stage 4
 gpm_colony.4130.name:1 "Proposal: Dissident Work Camps"
 gpm_colony.4130.desc:1 "A proposal is on the table to convert a large number of abandoned infrastructure sites into sophisticated work camps. Criminals will spend their sentence there and work on various projects to benefit society. These projects will include manual labour, such as cleaning and trash collecting, as well as more challenging assignments."
 gpm_colony.4130.a:1 "Approve the proposal."
 # Capital Event - authoritarian -> Work Camps stage 5
 gpm_colony.4140.name:1 "Completion of Work Camps"
 gpm_colony.4140.desc:1 "The construction of a large number of work camps has been completed. These camps, while sounding dreadful, are actually very accommodating. They offer a surprisingly high amount of comfort and care. Three meals a day and ample activity will be provided free for all inmates."
 gpm_colony.4140.a:1 "A great solution."

 # Capital Event - egalitarian -> Galactic_Equality stage 1
 gpm_colony.4200.name:1 "Prosperity"
 gpm_colony.4200.desc:1 "For several years now, our citizens on our capital have been enjoying ever-increasing prosperity. This has led to them spontaneously choosing this day* as a day of celebration. Local politicians aren't standing by either. They have begun organizing festivities and events all across our cities. All this prosperity is the result of our policies on rights and privileges. Specifically, the guarantee that everyone on our capital is a free and equal citizen. Our citizens now want to grant these same rights to our colonies."
 gpm_colony.4200.a:1 "We will see."
 # Capital Event - egalitarian -> Galactic_Equality stage 2
 gpm_colony.4210.name:1 "Rights Movement"
 gpm_colony.4210.desc:1 "Several peaceful protests have been organized by our citizens and representatives of our colonies on our capital world. They are demanding equal rights for all citizens across our entire empire. No longer should a colonist or a 'homeworlder' be considered different. The people are demanding this be put into law everywhere."
 gpm_colony.4210.a:1 "Perhaps they are right."
 # Capital Event - egalitarian -> Galactic_Equality stage 3
 gpm_colony.4220.name:1 "Constitutional Proposal"
 gpm_colony.4220.desc:1 "Our government has put a proposal forward to declare equal rights for all citizens as a fundamental right in our constitution. This will be an amendment to include specific language declaring all citizens--whether born on our homeworld, on a colony, in space, or everywhere else--to be considered equal and granting the full rights and privileges that come with that equality. Our government officials will now vote to see if this becomes law."
 gpm_colony.4220.a:1 "Vote yes."
 gpm_colony.4220.c:1 "Vote no."
 # Capital Event - egalitarian -> Galactic_Equality stage 4
 gpm_colony.4230.name:1 "Constitutional equal rights for everyone passes!"
 gpm_colony.4230.desc:1 "A majority of our government has voted yes! All citizens, all members of our empire are now considered equal to the law. News of this is quickly spreading to our colonies, who are celebrating this joyous occasion, as well as neighbouring colonies of other species. This news might make us more liked among our allies and neighbours."
 gpm_colony.4230.a:1 "Truly a momentous occasion."

 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 1
 gpm_colony.4300.name:1 "Scientific Breakthroughs"
 gpm_colony.4300.desc:1 "After working tirelessly for years, our scientists have achieved a momentous breakthrough in their biological and cybernetic research. They have achieved the impossible; bridging the mind and the machine. Using specialised connectors, our scientists have managed to input data from brain cells into a computer chip and create new neurons by outputting new data from this computer chip. It should, in theory, be possible to scale up this system and make it work on a larger, more sophisticated brain. The science team behind this project is going to start developing techniques and methods to test the system on alive--but small--specimens."
 gpm_colony.4300.a:1 "Unbelievable."
 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 2
 gpm_colony.4310.name:1 "Brain-To-Machine Linking"
 gpm_colony.4310.desc:1 "Our latest research into cybernetic brain implants is proceeding well. Scientists report excellent results in brain-to-machine linking techniques. Tests on small animals have been a success; one such test involved a animals being given data on how to solve a maze and then successfully completing it. Our science teams want to start testing the system on higher intelligence test subjects, such as larger animals or perhaps even sentients. They would also like to begin optimizing the techniques and algorithms using advanced machine learning."
 gpm_colony.4310.a:1 "Keep me informed on the progress."
 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 3
 gpm_colony.4320.name:1 "Local Integration Nodes"
 gpm_colony.4320.desc:1 "Using machine learning to improve our understanding of brain-to-machine linking has produced unimaginable results! New materials and techniques have been developed to decrease the mortality rate to near 0. We believe the technology to apply this to our citizens is ready for large-scale deployment now. It's probably a good idea to see if the population is ready for this kind of invasive procedure though."
 gpm_colony.4320.a:1 "Excellent, continue the work."
 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 4
 gpm_colony.4330.name:1 "Integration Nodes Standardisation"
 gpm_colony.4330.desc:1 "Our latest research suggests our citizens are open and ready to use the brain-machine linking technology. Studies have shown very little social resistance to this idea. We've come up with a set of standardisation code that all new building projects will have to follow. New buildings will be outfitted with integration data nodes. People can plug their implants into these nodes and download or upload data directly to their brains."
 gpm_colony.4330.a:1 "Sounds good."
 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 5
 gpm_colony.4340.name:1 "Widespread Integration Nodes"
 gpm_colony.4340.desc:1 "As newer building projects are being outfitted with integration nodes, there is an increasing demand to have these nodes in government buildings. People want to be able to continue their work and access their entertainment while they wait in our government buildings and centres. A demand for these nodes in public places is rapidly growing as well. We should dedicate some of our infrastructure funding to upgrade existing infrastructure."
 gpm_colony.4340.a:1 "Approve the funding changes."
 # Capital Event - materialist -> Augment_Integrated_Systems stage 6
 gpm_colony.4350.name:1 "Free Data-Link Augments"
 gpm_colony.4350.desc:1 "A large number of our citizens have now opted to be augmented with a data link and have undergone the procedure. They can now 'plug in' to these integration nodes all across our homeworld. While the number of citizens who have augmented is lower than anticipated, the participation rate is steadily increasing. We've decided it would be a good idea to subsidize the next generation of data-link augments and integration nodes. This way, the barrier of entry will be much lower for most citizens. Very soon, every resident of our homeworld will be utilising these implants and nodes to vastly improve their capabilities."
 gpm_colony.4350.a:1 "Knowledge is power."

 # Capital Event - spiritualist -> Mysterious_Force stage 1
 gpm_colony.4400.name:1 "Meditation is the Path to Enlightenment"
 gpm_colony.4400.desc:1 "Citizens across several cities on our capital world have requested public meditation locations where they can come together, talk about life, and meditate. This odd request seems to be the result of a new philosophy that is spreading amongst our population. This philosophy teaches that true peace and tranquillity can only be found by understanding the universe through both science and meditation. After all, knowledge is nothing without contemplation."
 gpm_colony.4400.a:1 "One with the force."
 # Capital Event - spiritualist -> Mysterious_Force stage 2
 gpm_colony.4410.name:1 "Strange Feelings"
 gpm_colony.4410.desc:1 "Several individuals who spend most of their leisure time meditating are experiencing a strange sensation. A certain sense of tranquillity, of peace, has overcome them. They end up speaking more slowly and in softer voices. No scientific explanation has been found so far, though it is believed that this is nothing more than a mental condition."
 gpm_colony.4410.a:1 "And yet, I feel something..."
 # Capital Event - spiritualist -> Mysterious_Force stage 3
 gpm_colony.4420.name:1 "Wave of Understanding"
 gpm_colony.4420.desc:1 "A sudden wave of energy has burst from our capital world and is spreading outwards into space in all directions. Citizens are reporting a strong feeling of calmness. While we can't be sure, it appears this wave is connected with the increasing number of citizens who feel a sense of tranquillity. Even our leaders are beginning to experience a change in their understanding of life. The universe has opened up to us; maybe we should listen."
 gpm_colony.4420.a:1 "I think I will meditate on this."
 # Capital Event - spiritualist -> Mysterious_Force stage 4
 gpm_colony.4430.name:1 "Mysterious Force"
 gpm_colony.4430.desc:1 "Over these past few months, ever since the energy wave event, there have been reports of people being able to do things. Strange things. Scientifically impossible things. Yet, it is all happening. Some of our citizens have been seen moving objects with their mind, such as closing and opening doors at will. Others can manipulate the very energy in our lights. Some individuals appear to be communicating to each other without saying a word.\nThis doesn't just affect the people either! Even nature is acting strange. Wild animals appear very calm when citizens are close, and vice versa. It is almost as if everyone knows not to fear each other. Something has changed on our world.\nThe question now becomes, how should we proceed? How do we use this force? Is it a force for good? Or one for evil? Do we use it to help the weak, or do we use it to our advantage and grow strong? There are so many questions that require answers."
 gpm_colony.4430.a:1 "The force is..."

 
 # 57 e
 # Capital Event - military -> Mandatory_Military_Service stage 1
 gpm_colony.4500.name:1 "Caution is Recommended"
 gpm_colony.4500.desc:1 "Our military leaders advise that we should be cautious in our interactions with the alien species we have encountered. Though we may be at peace with another race now, it is possible they may choose to attack us in the future. Our advisors recommend we continue to monitor our neighbors and their fleet movements for any sign of threat to our empire."
 gpm_colony.4500.a:1 "Those who may be our friends today could be our enemies tomorrow."
 # Capital Event - military -> Mandatory_Military_Service stage 2
 gpm_colony.4510.name:1 "New Training Programs"
 gpm_colony.4510.desc:1 "Although we already use rigorous training programs for our soldiers, those in charge believe these methods need to be updated to further improve our armies' capabilities. Without new training programs, our military leaders warn that we might lose the next intergalactic war we enter. The proposed training methods will ensure our troops are better prepared for whatever military challenges we might face. The fate of our empire may someday rest on the shoulders of our soldiers."
 gpm_colony.4510.a:1 "Approve the new training methods."
 # Capital Event - military -> Mandatory_Military_Service stage 3
 gpm_colony.4520.name:1 "Recruitment Drive"
 gpm_colony.4520.desc:1 "The new training methods in space combat and simulating planetary invasions are going well. We should be better prepared for any inevitable war now. However, our numbers remain low, and our military leaders insist that we need more specialised soldiers. They recommend that we organize a recruitment drive on our capital world. This event will offer citizens a chance to learn more about military service, as well as encourage people to join the military."
 gpm_colony.4520.a:1 "Organize a recruitment drive."
 # Capital Event - military -> Mandatory_Military_Service stage 4
 gpm_colony.4530.name:1 "Mandatory Military Service"
 gpm_colony.4530.desc:1 "For many years, we have allowed our citizens to voluntarily choose to serve in our military forces. However, with changing times and increasing numbers of potential threats, we can no longer rely on our citizens' patriotism to ensure our military remains a viable force. To cover every possible enemy tactic and strategy, we need to train everyone able to serve. Our military leaders propose that we institute mandatory military service on our capital world."
 gpm_colony.4530.a:1 "This is a sound idea. We need more capable soldiers."
 # Capital Event - military -> Mandatory_Military_Service stage 5
 gpm_colony.4540.name:1 "Strong Together"
 gpm_colony.4540.desc:1 "It has taken time and great expense, but at last there is infrastructure in place to provide military training to every able citizen on our capital world. Our military advisors are pleased by the results so far, and reports from the general populace have been enthusiastic about the new military mandate. As of today, our capital world is fully combat ready, and our empire is all the stronger for it."
 gpm_colony.4540.a:1 "No enemy will bring us down now."

 # Capital Event - pacifist -> Monument_To_The_Stars stage 1
 gpm_colony.4600.name:1 "Eyes on the Heavens"
 gpm_colony.4600.desc:1 "For eons, our people have gazed up at the stars, enjoying the sense of peace and tranquility they provide. Some find loneliness in the vast inky blackness, others feel small when they ponder our position in the vast universe. However, our artists and scientists have long been inspired by the stars, and all of our people are encouraged to imagine what might lie beyond our sight. Who knows what unseen wonders the stars hold?"
 gpm_colony.4600.a:1 "The search for life continues."
 # Capital Event - pacifist -> Monument_To_The_Stars stage 2
 gpm_colony.4610.name:1 "How to Say 'Peace'"
 gpm_colony.4610.desc:1 "Our people want a way to express our desire to meet new species and show them that we love all life. This should be a sign that can be seen and enjoyed by everyone. A prominent artist on our capital world has put forth the suggestion for a monolithic monument, one that can convey a message of peace to all who dwell in our galaxy."
 gpm_colony.4610.a:1 "A monument is an excellent idea."
 # Capital Event - pacifist -> Monument_To_The_Stars stage 3
 gpm_colony.4620.name:1 "Construction Begins"
 gpm_colony.4620.desc:1 "With our permission, the artist who proposed the idea of a monument has assembled a team to design it. The designs have been reviewed, altered, reviewed again, and tested through a series of simulations and models. Now that they are approved, construction of the monument has begun on our capital world. This will be a huge undertaking, one that will require a lot of materials and time to complete."
 gpm_colony.4620.a:1 "Keep me updated."
 # Capital Event - pacifist -> Monument_To_The_Stars stage 4
 gpm_colony.4630.name:1 "Obstructions of Construction"
 gpm_colony.4630.desc:1 "The construction of the monument is about halfway done. Unfortunately, the architects and construction workers in charge of assembling the massive monument have experienced some delays, putting the project behind schedule. This is due to the crowds that frequently form around the construction site, which has been attracting more attention than we anticipated. Everyone wants to see this history in the making. To solve this problem, an artist proposed allowing citizens to volunteer time to help on the project. This has met with great success, and the waiting list to volunteer is now quite long. Extra patrols ensure that the crowds are kept at a safe distance, allowing work to resume at a normal rate."
 gpm_colony.4630.a:1 "Continue with its construction."
 # Capital Event - pacifist -> Monument_To_The_Stars stage 5
 gpm_colony.4640.name:1 "Monument to the Stars"
 gpm_colony.4640.desc:1 "Towering over our main capital city, the completed monument is an intricate and breathtaking achievement. Not only is it a sign to the galaxy of peace, it is also a sign of the unity of our people, who came together to work on this project for many, many months. Its design is an elaborate one, yet it gives a sense of peace to all who view it, whether from below or above. Smooth ceramic, curved metal, and shiny crystal merge as one into a monument truly worthy of the stars. This shining beacon of hope and peace radiates a message throughout our solar system and beyond: 'We offer peace. We offer love. We offer friendship.' It is our hope that all who hear this message, whether allies or aliens we have not yet met, will understand it and reach out with the same message to us."
 gpm_colony.4640.a:1 "Truly a monument to the stars."

 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 1
 gpm_colony.4700.name:1 "Unfair Trading Practices"
 gpm_colony.4700.desc:1 "Citizens across our empire are complaining about unfair trade practices from neighbouring empires. Although the complaints tend to be vague rather than specific in nature, our initial inquiries into the matter have suggested that xeno traders are disregarding our local trade and border laws. Outraged by this implication, officials are lobbying for a more in-depth investigation into the matter."
 gpm_colony.4700.a:1 "Start an investigation."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 2
 gpm_colony.4710.name:1 "Investigating the Xeno Traders"
 gpm_colony.4710.desc:1 "The investigation into the xeno trade practices is well underway. Although we have contacted representatives of the neighbouring empires, they have evaded our questions and refuse to offer assistance. They claim the traders are independent from their empires and thus they have no reason to look into the matter. Meanwhile, xeno traders are continuing to break our trade laws and undermine local economies. Although our neighbors' apathy is frustrating, we must keep investigating the matter. The very well-being of our empire could be at stake."
 gpm_colony.4710.a:1 "Continue the investigation."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 3
 gpm_colony.4720.name:1 "Xeno Traders can't be Trusted"
 gpm_colony.4720.desc:1 "The investigation into the xeno trading practices is complete. It has become clear that they are breaking almost every existing local trade law. Closing our borders to them has no effect, as they simply find ways around our patrols and current identification protocols. A proposal has been put forward to outright ban trading without government-issued permits and allow local military ships to escort xeno traders out of our space."
 gpm_colony.4720.a:1 "Approve the ban."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 4
 gpm_colony.4730.name:1 "Stronger Measures are Necessary"
 gpm_colony.4730.desc:1 "Despite our best efforts to keep xeno traders out of our empire, many are outright violating the ban on unlicensed trade. These rogue xeno traders have also become quite cunning in their trade practices, easily avoiding or evading our much slower military ships. Something must be done. Our colonies are suffering. Although we have asked our neighbors again for their assistance, they have refused. What else can be done to protect our empire?"
 gpm_colony.4730.a:1 "Issue a new directive: hunt them down."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 5
 gpm_colony.4740.name:1 "Piracy Begins"
 gpm_colony.4740.desc:1 "Our military has launched several small campaigns to hunt down these rogue xeno traders. Although initial attempts seemed successful, reports soon began pouring in again; first from our outlying systems, and then from those colonies closer to our empire's core. Many of these rogue xenos have turned to outright piracy, cheating and stealing from one colony to sell to another. Some have started exporting inferior resources to our colonies with often disastrous results. Unless something is done to stop these pirates, our economy could collapse."
 gpm_colony.4740.a:1 "Issue civilian bounties."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 6
 gpm_colony.4750.name:1 "The Hunt Begins"
 gpm_colony.4750.desc:1 "Our new policy of allowing civilians to hunt these rogue xeno traders and pirates for a bounty has proven quite popular and effective. At last, our outer colonies can begin to thrive under their own trade. Although we still get frequent reports of rogue traders, we receive just as many notifications of bounties posted and collected. Our officials and our civilians are quite pleased with the results, and it has been suggested that we establish this bounty hunting as a permanent policy."
 gpm_colony.4750.a:1 "We shall do so."
 # Capital Event - xenophobe -> Ministery_Of_The_Hunt stage 7
 gpm_colony.4760.name:1 "Ministry Of The Hunt"
 gpm_colony.4760.desc:1 "After much debate and far too much paperwork, we have successfully established the Ministry of the Hunt. This new government organisation will oversee all regulations and policies regarding bounty hunting. They will handle the rules of engagement, territory hunting rights, and payment systems. What started out as a troublesome problem with xeno traders has flourished into a new economic opportunity for our citizens. Our empire has grown stronger thanks to the failed efforts of those traders and pirates who thought to weaken us for their own benefit. No longer will they be a threat to us, and this ministry will ensure that our citizens are properly compensated for their efforts."
 gpm_colony.4760.a:1 "We will all benefit from this."

 # Capital Event - xenophile -> Galactic_Outreach_Program stage 1
 gpm_colony.4800.name:1 "Celebrating Friendship"
 gpm_colony.4800.desc:1 "Local governors on our capital world are thinking about instituting a day of celebration honoring diversity and our new alien neighbours. They are requesting that our government make this a global holiday to show our appreciation for our alien friends as well as offer an opportunity to reach out to all other life in the galaxy."
 gpm_colony.4800.a:1 "We should make it a galactic holiday instead!"
 # Capital Event - xenophile -> Galactic_Outreach_Program stage 2
 gpm_colony.4810.name:1 "Could We do More?"
 gpm_colony.4810.desc:1 "The first annual, galactic celebration of diversity and equality for all species proved a resounding success. Our citizens are very happy that this holiday has been created. However, our government wonders if we can do more than this simple commemoration to show how much we care for the good of all in the galaxy."
 gpm_colony.4810.a:1 "Let us discuss this internally."
 # Capital Event - xenophile -> Galactic_Outreach_Program stage 3
 gpm_colony.4820.name:1 "Extending a Hand in Friendship"
 gpm_colony.4820.desc:1 "After a long and heartfelt debate, our government has decided that on this holiday we will always put extra resources into reaching out to every other civilisation in the galaxy. Whether they are friends or foes, we shall extend a hand in friendship in hopes they will do the same. On this day, we will always consider everyone, within our civilisation and without, to be our friends and try to find mutual interests and values."
 gpm_colony.4820.a:1 "This will be a foundation of our empire as well."
 # Capital Event - xenophile -> Galactic_Outreach_Program stage 4
 gpm_colony.4830.name:1 "You have a Friend in Me"
 gpm_colony.4830.desc:1 "Our government has passed a formal and binding bill that makes this outreach program and holiday a fundamental part of our society. The announcement led to celebrations in the streets of our capital world and across our empire as our citizens cheered for this latest step in our journey to create a galaxy full of hope and friendship."
 gpm_colony.4830.a:1 "Everyone will always be welcome."

 # Capital Event - hive mind -> Synopsys_Nodes stage 1
 gpm_colony.4900.name:1 "Strained Connections"
 gpm_colony.4900.desc:1 "The vastness of our empire is part of what makes our civilisation strong. However, it is also becoming a weakness, for the great distances make it more difficult to maintain control over our citizens. Our government officials are concerned that without a solution to this problem, our societal integrity will become irreparably damaged."
 gpm_colony.4900.a:1 "We will research this issue."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> Synopsys_Nodes stage 2
 gpm_colony.4910.name:1 "Improving Our Link"
 gpm_colony.4910.desc:1 "Our scientists believe the problem of maintaining a hive connection across our vast empire can be solved by a combination of genome editing and cybernetic implants. By changing our physical form to be compatible with very specialised implants, we could theoretically enhance the hive mind connection by a factor of a thousand or more."
 gpm_colony.4910.a:1 "This is a possible solution. Pursue it."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> Synopsys_Nodes stage 3
 gpm_colony.4920.name:1 "Initial Experimentation"
 gpm_colony.4920.desc:1 "The proposed combination of genome editing and cybernetic implants has proven successful in initial laboratory experiments. Small-scale genome editing of single cells has shown promise in that these modified cells can interact with a simple electronic device. Larger scale experimentation is necessary to determine if this is possible with more complex signals."
 gpm_colony.4920.a:1 "Continue the research."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> Synopsys_Nodes stage 4
 gpm_colony.4930.name:1 "Further Experimentation"
 gpm_colony.4930.desc:1 "Our scientists have labored over this project, facing setback after setback and obstacle after obstacle. Although at times they feared a solution would never be found, the experiments with genome editing and cybernetic connections finally proved successful. We can now begin testing these techniques and implants, called synopsys nodes, on civilian test subjects."
 gpm_colony.4930.a:1 "Let us hope this works."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> Synopsys_Nodes stage 5
 gpm_colony.4940.name:1 "We Are One"
 gpm_colony.4940.desc:1 "The first few test subjects rejected the implants, but further modification of the genome corrected this problem. Our latest tests with synopsys nodes have proven quite successful. Adaptation of our citizens on our capital world has already begun, and it will continue until our hive connection is strong enough to reach every end of our galaxy. As we strengthen our link, so too do we strengthen our empire."
 gpm_colony.4940.a:1 "This is a great day for us."

 # Capital Event - machine empires -> Rapid_Assembly_Systems stage 1
 gpm_colony.5000.name:1 "Slumming It"
 gpm_colony.5000.desc:1 "For years, our focus has been on expanding our empire. The more territory, the better. However, with so much effort spent on establishing our colonies, the infrastructure on our capital world has become obsolete. Although the colonies on the outreaches of our empire are constantly implementing the latest technological improvements, our capital remains stagnant. In some cases, the technology here is no longer compatible with the newest implemented technologies on our colonies. Our leaders are advocating for upgrades to our infrastructure. How can we call ourselves the greatest race in the galaxy when some of our civilians live in such poor conditions?"
 gpm_colony.5000.a:1 "Begin planning these upgrades."
 # Capital Event - machine empires -> Rapid_Assembly_Systems stage 2
 gpm_colony.5010.name:1 "Time is of the Essence"
 gpm_colony.5010.desc:1 "Upgrading the infrastructure on our capital world is an urgent project, but it requires careful planning to avoid affecting current operations. After some consideration, several algorithmic systems were developed to determine the most optimal way to begin upgrading our older infrastructure. Now that the calculations are complete, some newly designed assembly systems can be built to speed up the construction of upgrade modules."
 gpm_colony.5010.a:1 "Gather the resources to do this."
 # Capital Event - machine empires -> Rapid_Assembly_Systems stage 3
 gpm_colony.5020.name:1 "All Systems are Go"
 gpm_colony.5020.desc:1 "It has taken some time to prepare, but at last the aging infrastructure on our capital world is ready to be upgraded. Careful planning has allowed us to intelligently distribute colossal amounts of resources to key points across the planet. Everything is now in place for the project to begin. It is expected that these upgrades will cause minimal interference with daily operations."
 gpm_colony.5020.a:1 "Good. Begin the upgrades."
 # Capital Event - machine empires -> Rapid_Assembly_Systems stage 4
 gpm_colony.5030.name:1 "One Piece at a Time"
 gpm_colony.5030.desc:1 "As requested by our leaders, our workers have submitted a report on the progress of our infrastructure modifications. We are about halfway done and are remarkably on schedule. There has been no serious interference with our normal operations. The planet is producing resources at nominal values during the upgrade process. Provided the rest of the project proceeds as planned, we expect to finish these upgrades soon."

 gpm_colony.5040.desc:1 "The upgrades to the infrastructure of our capital world have been completed at last. Our capital world is once again the pinnacle of our civilisation. The newly installed modern systems and software are running at optimal conditions, and our resource output has never been higher. We can now turn our focus once again toward expansion and the further development of our empire's technology. Never again will we let our capital world fall into such disrepair. For our empire to be great, we must maintain every aspect of it."
