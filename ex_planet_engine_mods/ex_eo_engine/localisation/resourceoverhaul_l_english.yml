STRATEGIC_RESOURCES_TITLE:0 "§HStrategic Resources§!"
STRATEGIC_RESOURCES_DESC:2 "There are two main types of strategic resources. The first are strategic resources that are necessary for ENERGY £energy , FOOD £food and INDUSTRIAL RESOURCES £minerals ; without these strategic resources you empire will grind to a halt. Always ensure your empire has adequate access to them. These include::\n§Y1.§! HYDROGEN £sr_hydrogen - Hydrogen Power Plants and Hydrocarbon Facilities;:\n§Y1.§!HELIUM-3 £sr_helium3 - Helium-3 Power Plants;:\n§T1.§! CARBON £sr_carbon - Hydrocarbon Plant;:\n§Y1.§!Industrial Metals £sr_industrial_metals - Industrial Facilities;:\n§Y1.§!Rare Earth Metals £sr_rare_earth_metals - Industrial Facilities;:\n§Y1.§! Water £sr_water - Hydroponic Farms; and :\n§Y1.§! Pnictogen £sr_pnictogen - Hydroponic Farms."

STRATEGIC_RESOURCES_DESC:3 "The second type of strategic resource aren't necessary for an empire to function, but provide valuable bonuses economically, scientifically, militarily and socially. Access to these types of strategic Resources will usually grant you Empire-wide bonuses. You only need access to a single unit to receive the full benefit, so excess units can freely be traded away."

energy:0 "Energy"
energy_desc:1 "§W§YEnergy§! (£energy ) is necessary to provide power for ships, buildings and stations. It is also used as a universal currency. \n\n§YEnergy§! is produced by :\n§Y1.§! Securing §YHydrogen§!; and :\n§Y1.§! Constructing §YPower Plants§!, which will then use the hydrogen to provide energy."

minerals:0 "Industrial Resources"
minerals_desc:1 "§W§RIndustrial Resources§ (!£minerals ) are necessary for the construction and maintenance of ships, buildings and stations. \n\n§RIndustrial Resources§! are produced by our §RIndustrial Facilities§! on planets and spaceports. They represent the conversion of natural elements into various components and alloys used for the production of consumer goods, ships, buildings and stations. This is achieved by securing sources of §HIndustrial Metals§! and §TRare Earth Metals§!, and constructing §RIndustrial Facitilies§! on planets and spaceports to process them into industrial resources."
