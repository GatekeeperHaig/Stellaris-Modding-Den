HW: Patch - NSC2 - Outpost

Version: 1.1
Modifies: (-NSC2 Season 2 - Episode 1 - Mod Version 2.1.x-)

Requires
* (-NSC2 Season 2 - Episode 1 - Mod Version 2.1.x-)
* Outpost


This mod patches NSC2 to work with Outpost, allowing outposts to be listed in
the outliner.


Loading Screens
This mod also tweaks the NSC2 loading screens. Rather than replacing vanilla
loading screens, NSC2 loading screens are now additional.


Updates
The authors of NSC2 like to change the title with each update they do. That
means that when they update, this mod breaks. Whist waiting for me to update
this mod you can fix the patch by editing hw_nsc2_outpost.mod and replacing the
replace_path with the new NSC2 title.


Enjoy,

Hereward
