Ever had the problem that early game was way to hard and either you die early, or the game becomes boring very soon afterwards? Or do you think the game is too hard/easy in general and the player would deserve some bonuses/penalties? Or do you want stronger Fallen Empires. Or you want to reduce resource overflow in late game? The crisis or Great Khan is a lackluster or ruining your game? Or, or, or...

Then this mod if for you!


[h1]Features[/h1]
1. Choosing any of the Vanilla pre-defined difficulties in mid-game. Mod can even be installed mid-game.
2. "Scaling" difficulty can be combined with other predefined difficulties (added on top).
3. Is fully customizeable. You can change 10 different types of bonuses in 7 empire categories (AI, Player, FE+AE, Leviathans, Crisis, Marauders, Other) to a precision of 1% (10% for player) and in a huge range: -127% to + 1023% for AI, -100% to 200% for player and -75% to 5115% for crisis.
4. Allows locking of the customized difficulty for MP (Troll prevention) or other reasons. Unlock via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1354362281]sub-mod[/url].
5. Moved "Diplomatic Influence Upkeep reduction" from a bonus every AI gets to scale with difficulty and be customizeable.

[h1]IMPORTANT[/h1]
- Main menu can be opened via [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1087781345]Mod Menu[/url].
- Alternatively, the menu is started via a Country Edict.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
I have strongly improved performance. TLTR: About 26 times faster than the beta.
Only modifiers that actually change are removed and applied.
I tried a test of doing 25 yearly updates on my laptop in a row with Huge Galaxy, 30 AIs, 5 FEs, 3 Marauders and standard scaling (thus changing modifiers every 4 updates).
The beta took 26 seconds for this, the final version about 1 second (Stellaris log isn't more precise than that). 
If you still should have problems, you can activate a delay mode in the options 
that let's the country updates on modifiers have a random delay, spreading the computations over half a Stellaris year.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Can be added into a running game. You need to wait 1 day in this case before being able to open the menu.
- Can be uninstalled during a game (resetting to difficulty set when starting the game). Simply removing the mod will leave over "?" modifiers (who won't do anything), but there is an "uninstall" option in the Menu. Should you afterwards want to install the mod again in the same save-game, this will only work via console: "event custom_difficulty.20".
- Should have very few conflicts with other mods. Only overwrites vanilla difficulty settings. If a mod adds new country types (like a new crisis) they would fall in the "Other" category. New races and predefined empires will always be "AI" without a problem (checking for "default" country).
- Created for Stellaris 2.2.*. There is a separate legacy mod for 2.1.* (works mostly with 2.0.1 as well)
- (Obviously) Not Achievement compatible.

[h1]Localization[/h1]
- "pt","en","fr", "de","pl","ru", "es" language files given but all mostly English. Most modifier and difficulty names are links to the Vanilla localization. 

[h1]Options[/h1]
- Choose between simple and custom (default) mode. Simple mode only changes modifiers in three categories. Thus much less modifiers are needed which improves the performance even more. Switching between the two works without losing any previously done settings. Switching to simple will use the value of the first bonus (Minerals, Research, Weapon damage) as group bonus. When changing the group, values for all entries are still changed while in simple mod.
- Player Vassal Bonuses: Choose between giving them the same bonus as the player (default) or the AI bonuses.
- Delay Mode: Changed Modifier changes are either applied whenever closing the menu and at the start of each year (default) or 1-181 afterwards.
