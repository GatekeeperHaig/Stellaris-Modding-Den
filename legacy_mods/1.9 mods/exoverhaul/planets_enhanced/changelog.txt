This mod does multiple things. It is also work in progress and I will add more and more features and content to it over time. 

This mod is a planet enhancement mod. Its aim is to make planets more interesting while preserving the vanilla paradigm. It plays well with other mods, but is intended to offer players who want it a vanilla feel while expanding on both mechanics and content.

Content-wise it adds [u]22+3[/u] strategic resources to the game: [u]10 orbital resources, 6 planetary resource, 6 unique resources (1 planet per type) and 3 vanilla resources that are converted from being orbital to be planetary.[/u]
It also adds 15 planetary buildings - 6 unique buildings - 1 per galaxy of each type, and 9 planet unique ones. 
It adds special modifiers to [u]Gaia Worlds, Ringworlds and Tomb Worlds.[/u]

Mechanics-wise at adds 2 unique things:

1. this mod is 100% savegame compatible and you can load it into a game you didn't start with it. It doesn't matter because it doesn't use the vanilla initalizers but instead spawns resources and modifiers through events only
<IMPORTANT> One month after you start playing, the game will look like its freezing for a long time (30secs-1min+-). Its not freezing - its just running an event that: (a) removes 3 vanilla resources - pitharan, engos and satrameme, and replaces them with replacement resources that have the same name/description/icon but are planetary resources. It then spawns the new resourecs, doing a series of rolls for planet/resource: orbital resources are gated to specific planet types, and spawn on some of them with 1 modifier applied, planetary resources are rolled only for habitable planets, with some planets being more likely than others, and the 6 unique resources are randomly disributed on 6 planets that have no owner. It also spawns the resources as needed, and once you build a new ringworld or terraform to gaia these get the special modifiers immediatly.

2. it adds a new terraforming mechanism: 

(a) [u]Terraforming increases the number of tiles on the planet:[/u] The reasoning here is the creation of artificial landmasses and huge scale land reclamation as part of the terraforming process. Mechanic-wise this works thus: when terraforming a planet below 23 in size, there is a 50% it will increase in 1 tile, 40% for 2 tiles and 10% it will increase in 3 tiles. When terraforming a size 23 or 24 planet, there is an 80% chance it will increase in 1 tile, and 20% chance it will not increase in size. This function will work only the first time a planet is terraformed to prevent abuse. 
(b) [u]Terraforming adds a special planet modifier: [/u] This modifier gives a small +5% habitability / +5% border extrusion bonuses. It reflect the fact this planet's ecology and geosphere has been optimized, as well as the long term influence impact of such a monumental undertaking.
(c) [u]Terraforming removes almost all negative modifiers from a planet (including the Abandoned Terraforming modifier). The exception to this are the modifiers Tidal Locked, High Gravity and Mineral Poor, which cannot be removed for conceptual reasons (e.g. tidal locked means this planet is locked by a gas giant's gravity field, high gravity means this planet is extremely dense.) 

[h1]planned features[/h1]
1. Mod menu that allows you to configure resource spawn
2. Extending the mod engine to allow for planet replacement, and integration of ExOverhaul: Cybertronic Worlds as a toggleable optional feature (turn on/off in a menu) of this mod. 
3. Add homeworld unique planet modifiers that change according to ethic + allow for the anchroing of event chains (integration with event mods).

[u]You guys are welcome to post your ideas here, but its easier for me if you use discord to give feedback, bug-reports, make requests or offer suggestions[/u]. This is a permanent invite to our discord (text based chat server): https://discord.gg/mf5Tr9c
