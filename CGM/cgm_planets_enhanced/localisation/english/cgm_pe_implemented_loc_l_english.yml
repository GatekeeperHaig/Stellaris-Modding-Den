This resource is not found in deposits at all, instead the amount of this resource an empire gets every month is calculated using an event. This resource is then used for advanced terraforming. When a player has an income of at least 3 terraforming agent points or more, advanced terraforming of regular uninhabitable planets using the $building_terraformer$ building becomes possible. "

#Orbital SRs
sr_meta_organics:0 "Meta-Organic Compounds"

Launchers using such warheads may reload and fire considerably faster, as they're safer than typical launchers."
sr_cryodine:0 "Cryodine Ice"
sr_cryodine_desc:0 "This substance, upon its initial discovery, was believed to have nearly unlimited thermal capacity. It was later proven that it can somehow transfer stored energy across vast distances, even through vacuums. This makes cryodine a perfect coolant."

Once it stabilizes, it becomes exceptionally hard."
sr_neorite:0 "Neorite Crystals"
sr_neorite_desc:0 "Neorite Crystals refract EM waves perfectly. Their unique optical properties enable the construction of truly flawless sensors."
sr_hyper_diamond:0 "Hyperdiamond"

sr_archeological_remains_desc:0 "This area contains archaeological remains of an extinct alien civilization."
sr_iron_wood:0 "Ironwood"
sr_iron_wood_desc:0 "This precursor plant was seeded on different worlds sometimes during the deep past. Its wood is very pliable when wet, but once it dries it becomes as hard as industrial grade steel, providing a cheap and useful building material."
