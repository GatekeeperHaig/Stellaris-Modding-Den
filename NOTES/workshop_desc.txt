[h1]Core Game Mechanics: Planet Enhanced Open Beta[/h1]

[u]This is an open beta version of CGM: Planets Enhaced. The mod will be officially release as non-beta either this Friday (1.6 or the following one 8.6), at this point the beta will be deprecated and eventualy removed.[/u]


[h1]Compatibility and Synergy[/h1]

1. This mod [u]overwrites only two types of files- terraforming links and habitability traits[/u] otherwise it is completely script based and does not use the vanilla initializers for anything. It therefore requires compability patches only with mods that overwrite these files. Some compatibility patches will be published in the future - after the actual release. 

2. This mod has an extended mod menu in which you can turn almost all of its functionality on/off as you please. You can in fact play 99% vanilla content with this mod and only use some of its galaxy configuration features (example: resize planets!.) The only things that permanently change are habitability traits and most strategic resource icons. One of which is a great improvement over the original.  

3. This mod is 100% compatible with Guilli's Planet Modifiers and Legendary Worlds. It has in built synergy with Guilli's.

[h1]Mod Features[/h1]


[list]
[*] The mod is 100% savegame compatible - you can load it into an existing savegame.

[*] This mod has built in synergy with the new version of Planetary Diversity. It also has integral synergy with Real Space and it has specific configuration for both Real Space and Vanilla. You can play it vanilla or together with any of these mods with excellent results. 

[*] This mod is built to work together with [url=(see the infographics for details)]CGM: Buildings - it has full autobuild support and AI enhancement through that mod. It is highly recommended that you use the two together, since this mod allows you to decrease deposits and have a more balanced play together.[/url] 

[*] The mod's spawn engine is configurable. The star-up menu allows you to configure the following things:
-configure the amount and type of strategic resources (mod and/or vanilla)
-configure the size of habitable planets and homeworlds
-configure the size and amount of planetary deposits
-configure the amount and type of tile blockers (mod and/or vanilla)
-turn mod content and features  on/off : New Worlds Planets, Advanced Terraforming of Uninhabitable Planets, Planetary Exploitations and Asteroid Colonization.
[/list]

[h1]Mod Content[/h1]
[list]
[*] [u]replaces most of the vanilla strategic resource icons with great new icons[/u] - only for those resources that have recolors of the same icon as other resources, which is most of them. 

[*] Integrates Lex Peregrine's New Worlds mod - this is now an optional but integral part of this mod. It [u]adds 7 new habitable planets, 6 new uninhabitable planets and 2 new gas giants[/u]. It also adds new multiple textures to many vanilla planets, ensuring a richer experience.

[*] This mod adds [u]55 new strategic resources[/u]: 17 normal planetary strategic resources (work like alien pets or betharian in vanilla), 9 unique planetary resources (spawn on 1 tile in the entire galaxy each), 14 orbital strategic resources (like the vanilla ones) and 2 synethethic/abstract resources. (see the infographics for details)

[*] This mod [u]adds more than 80 new tile blockers[/u]. Some are just aesthethic, some are rare or unique and others are tied to the new terraforming and exploitation mechanics.

[*] This mod [u]adds 29 planetary buildings[/u] and [u]22 starbase buildings[/u] (one for each resource added by this mod, and one for each normal vanilla strategic resource), each with a unique very high quality sprite (see the infographics for details) .

[*] a number of new technologies tied to its various functions - each with a unique high quality sprite as well..

[*] a new uninhabitable planet terraforming mechanic (see infographic for more details).

[*] a new planetary exploitation mechanic (infographic coming soon)

[*] a new asteroid colonization mechanic (still WIP at this point)

[*] terraforming after effects (still WIP at this point)

[/list]

As of this moment the mod is for the most part finished. Some tech icons are still missing and some features are still being worked on/implemented, but you can defintely play with this mod on. 

More documentation and other stuff will be added here once I write it. You can read [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSHq5D7lHKa5wG0Pddvi-Y3baeMKCzOLBR4JcNwPCK45d0VAI6uAIFuAS7-vAAHUK83vA0YwFbxk9e4/pubhtml]the design doc here.[/url]

PLEASE NOTE: This mod will be removed from the workshop and replaced by the final version eventually (see top of this post).
