### Vanilla Planet Classifier

# planet groups 0-4: special planets, each with its own identifier
# 0 - nuked, 1 - gaia, 2 - machine, 3 ringworld, 4 habitat
# plant groups 5-7: regular habitable planets
# 5 - desert/arid/savannah, 6 - continental/tropical/ocean, 7 - arctic/tundra/alpine
# plant groups 10-16: inhabitable planets, each with its own identifier
# 10 - barren, 11 - barren cold, 12 - frozen, 13 - molten, 14 - toxic, 15 - asteroid, 16 - gas giant
# plant groups 17-20: collapsed stars, each with its own identifier
# 17 - black hole, 18 - neutron star, 19 - pulsar
# plant groups 20-25: stars, each with its own identifier
# 20 - class a, 21 - class b, 22 - class f, 23 - class g, 24 - class k, 25 - class m
