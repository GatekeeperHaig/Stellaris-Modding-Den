 GPM_BLACK_HOLE_CAT:0 "Alluring Darkness"
 gpm_anomaly.78877.name:0 "Inspirational"
 gpm_Inspirational:0 "§!Adds £physics §G12§! and §BDark Matter:§! §G1§! "
    
    # normal
 GPM_BLACK_HOLE_CAT_DESC:0 "There is something about this singularity, perhaps we should just stay a while."
 gpm_anomaly.78877.desc:0 "It is hard to think of practical applications of the black hole. Because practical applications are so remote, many people assume we should not be interested. But this quest to understand the world is what defines us as intelligent beings."
 # hive mind
 GPM_BLACK_HOLE_CAT_HIVE_DESC:0 "There is something alluring about this singularity, perhaps I should stay a while."
 gpm_anomaly.78877.desc.hive:0 "It is hard to think of practical applications of the black hole. Despite the difficult nature of singularities like this I must learn more about it. Only that way can I grow."
 # machine empire
 GPM_BLACK_HOLE_CAT_MACH_DESC:0 "This singularity is emitting unpredictable patterns. It must be observed and studied."
 gpm_anomaly.78877.desc.mach:0 "Initial observation of this singularity reveals it is not spinning. Until now the existence of this type of black hole has been a theoretical expectation. This non-spinning black hole will be categorized as a Schwarzschild black hole in the celestial databases. Its location and properties will further increase the accuracy of the galaxy and system generating models and processes."

 GPM_SUN_CAT:0 "Diamond in the sky"
 gpm_anomaly.78878.name:0 "Unusually Bright"
 gpm_sun_energy_deposit:0 "§!Adds £energy §G9§! "
    
    # normal
 GPM_SUN_CAT_DESC:0 "This sun seems very bright, a full orbital scan might shed some light on this phenomenon."
 gpm_anomaly.78878.desc:0 "This sun is unusually bright due to vastly increased surface solar activity. A rare combination of elements and gravitational pressure seems to be the cause of this unusual phenomenon. We could take advantage of this!"

 GPM_SUN_CAT_HIVE_DESC:0 "This sun seems very bright, a full orbital scan might shed some light on this phenomenon."
 gpm_anomaly.78878.desc.hive:0 "This sun is unusually bright due to vastly increased surface solar activity. A rare combination of elements and gravitational pressure seems to be the cause of this unusual phenomenon. I could take advantage of this!"
 # machine empire
 GPM_SUN_CAT_MACH_DESC:0 "Sensors detect increased energy emissions coming from this solar mass. An observation is required."
 gpm_anomaly.78878.desc.mach:0 "This solar mass is unexpectedly bright due to increased surface solar activity. an improbable combination of elements and gravitational pressure are theorized to be the primary variables of the higher emissions. The increased energy output of this solar mass is required to further advance our functions."

 GPM_WEIRD_CAT:0 "Something strange"
 gpm_anomaly.78879.name:0 "Time Displaced Planet"
 gpm_Time_Displaced_Planet:0 "§!Adds £physics §G6§! £society §G6§! £engineering §G6§!"
    
    # normal
 GPM_WEIRD_CAT_DESC:0 "Our scanners are detecting unusual readings. This world should not be where it is according to our long range scans and star charts. We should §Hdefinitely§! investigate."
 gpm_anomaly.78879.desc:0 "This world emits strange chronotron readings. Somehow this world has been displaced out of time. It is not known when this world was born, or when it is from, but it sure offers a lot of opportunities to learn about the nature of time itself!"
 # hive mind
 GPM_WEIRD_CAT_HIVE_DESC:0 "Our scanners are detecting unusual readings. This world should not be where it is according to our long range scans and star charts. §HI am intrigued§!."
 gpm_anomaly.78879.desc.hive:0 "This world emits strange chronotron readings. Somehow this world has been displaced out of time. It is not known when this world was born, or when it is from. I might learn more about the singular nature of time by further studying this world very closely. "
 # machine empire
 GPM_WEIRD_CAT_MACH_DESC:0 "Our scanners are detecting improbable readings. This world should not be where it is according to our navigational databases and galactic simulations. §HA series of tests and observations are required§!"
 gpm_anomaly.78879.desc.mach:0 "This world is emitting unexpected chronotron readings. This world has been displaced out of time by an unknown variable. Further observation and further experimentations will increase the probability of discovering the missing variables that have led to the displacement of this celestial body. Time must be studied further."

 # 4 anom
 GPM_PROTO_CAT:0 "Unusual emissions"
 gpm_anomaly.78880.name:0 "Protomolecule Infected Station"
 gpm_proto_molecule_deposit:0 "§!Adds £society §G12§! "
    
    # normal
 GPM_PROTO_CAT_DESC:0 "Our scanners are detecting unusual emissions coming from the surface of this asteroid. We should investigate."
 gpm_anomaly.78880.desc:0 "At first this asteroid station seemed abandoned, damaged. But as soon as we started listening to various electromagnetic channels we could hear strange voices, ever so slightly picking up in speed. On closer inspection the interior of the station is filled with strange crystals and a bizarrely moving bio-metal core, almost lifelike. The entire place sounds terrifying."

 GPM_PROTO_CAT_HIVE_DESC:0 "Scanners are detecting unusual emissions coming from the surface of this asteroid. We should investigate."
 gpm_anomaly.78880.desc.hive:0 "At first this asteroid station seemed abandoned, damaged. But as soon as I started listening to various electromagnetic channels I could hear strange voices, ever so slightly picking up in speed. On closer inspection the interior of the station is filled with strange crystals and a bizarrely moving bio-metal core, almost lifelike. The voices are singular in nature, but appear to be slowly becoming one, much like us. I must know more."
 # machine empire
 GPM_PROTO_CAT_MACH_DESC:0 "Scanners are detecting unusual emissions coming from the surface of this asteroid. Further scans are required."
 gpm_anomaly.78880.desc.mach:0 "After the initial scans the asteroid station seemed abandoned and damaged by exterior energy discharges. The interior has corroded by a strange energy field. Once the focus of our sensors was set to a narrower band they detected unusual sound patterns, ever so slightly picking up in speed. On closer observation of the interior strange crystals and a bizarrely moving bio-metal core was detected. The interior crystals seems to be consciously migrating to a single location within the station."

 GPM_CLOCK_CAT:0 "Flickering in the darkness"
 gpm_anomaly.78881.name:0 "Pulsar Clock"
 gpm_Pulsar_clock:0 "§!Adds £physics §G12§! and §BNeutronium§! §G1§! "
    
    # normal
 GPM_CLOCK_CAT_DESC:0 "Something about this pulsar seems very consistent. It pulses regularly while releasing immense amounts of energy."
 gpm_anomaly.78881.desc:0 "Not only is this pulsar fast, but it also spins with such amazing regularity that it is among the most accurate clocks in the universe. Using these celestial timekeepers, astronomers are answering questions about stars, matter - and even space and time itself - that would otherwise be impossible."

 gpm_anomaly.78881.desc.hive:0 "Not only is this pulsar fast, but it also spins with such amazing regularity that it is among the most accurate clocks in the universe. Using these celestial timekeepers, I can find answers to questions about stars, matter - and even space and time itself - that would otherwise be impossible."
 # machine empire
 GPM_CLOCK_CAT_MACH_DESC:0 "This pulsar is very consistent. It pulses regularly while releasing immense amounts of valuable energy."
 gpm_anomaly.78881.desc.mach:0 "This pulsar is spinning at a rare but predictable speed. It spins with such regularity that it is among the most accurate clocks in the universe. Using celestial timekeepers like this pulsar, our systems can keep their clock speeds within standard parameters resulting in far less synchronisation issues over distance."
