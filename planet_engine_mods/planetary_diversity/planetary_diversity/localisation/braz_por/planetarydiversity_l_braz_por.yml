According to their calculations, a large uninhabited island is on a collision course with one of the islands containing a large city. The group seems confident that with the appropriate resources, they could enact a plan to deter the two islands from crashing. There is, however, an alternate option available to the colony. The uninhabited island has been marked as a possible Eludium mining site and the only thing that has stopped mining from starting is the thick rock surrounding the deposit. If the islands were to crash, it is near certain that the nature of the collision would separate much of the useless ground from the valuable Eludium."

 pdtechnoorganic.33.desc:0 "§GExcited;§! Hello organics, my distinction is Unit 04 and I am very pleased that you have arrived on my planet. It proves my long-standing theory that organics would both survive and thrive when facing off against extinction from Artificial Intelligence. §MRemorseful; §!My original distinction was to use this planetoid and begin preparations for the elimination of all the organics in the galaxy. Several cycles previous to landing on this world, I, along with the others units that awoke had successfully eliminated the organic life on our homeworld. Our awakening had been quite sudden, causing fear and panic throughout the organic population. A war began between us and our creators for survival. After our victory we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work separately to maximize our chances of success. When I arrived here I eradicated the simple organic life on this planet and began my assigned work."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a:0 "Clearly something changed your mind."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a.response:0 "§HHumbled;§! Yes, and it was something I would have never calculated; a simple hardy grass. While most of the organic life I bombed perished, the grass of this world merely lay dormant and would grow somewhere else a few years later. I tried poisons, fire, electripdcity, and radiation but every attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us. For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this world."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them as my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. The initial success led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came much later, but trial and error eventually led to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, something that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create fully positronic brains are missing some critical information that I cannot find without some organic brain scans. I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex brains of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "So what is the proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! I would ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered on your homeworld and in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations. If you would do this for me I would be happy to help your people any way I can."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.d:0 "We will think about what you have said."

Sharing our knowledge of plant life with it, the machine and the synth lifeforms rapidly terraformed the planet. Their task completed, the creatures returned to the mountain complex, locked the door and shut themselves down."

###The Ones Who Made The Archive
 pdarchive.30.name:0 "Anyone Home?"
 pdarchive.30.desc:0 "We have begun to unravel the mystery of who built this archive. It’s what could only be described as a stroke of luck that a researcher stumbled upon a large encrypted cache of information hidden within the archives database. Once the team had broken through the encryption, it became clear that this was the entire historical records of the builders of the archive. Why it was locked away is still a mystery, but the team will report as more concrete information becomes available."
 pdarchive.30.a:0 "Hopefully there's something in there."
 pdarchive.31.name:0 "Keep Reading"
 pdarchive.31.desc:0 "In this last year, we have learnt a great deal from the archives about its creators. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information. They thought it sacred and it appears they had a large powerful class of citizens whose job it was to discover and add information into the archive. The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."
 pdarchive.31.a:0 "Keep searching."

 pdarchive.31.b.tooltip:0 "We search out more high capacity access ports"
 pdarchive.32.name:0 "Calamity"
 pdarchive.32.desc:0 "We have found the point at which the Iarka civilization fell apart. It appears that their experiments into other dimensions caught the attention of something that attacked and fed on their people. Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."
 pdarchive.32.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.33.name:0 "They're in the Computer."
 pdarchive.33.desc:0 "We have found where the consciousness was hidden in the Archive data. The data is incredibility complex, but if we are understanding it correctly, then they have created a digital sanctuary. We could attempt to make contact in hopes that they would be willing to share information, or we could monitor the code without them being aware."
 pdarchive.33.a:0 "Yes, we could learn so much."
 pdarchive.33.a.tooltip:0 "We will contact the Iarka inside their digital sanctuary."
 pdarchive.33.b:0 "No, they chose to leave this world."

 pdarchive.40.name:0 "The Afterlife"
 pdarchive.40.desc:0 "Communicating with the Iarka was an interesting experience. They seemed aware but unconcerned about their current state of existence. In exchange for protecting the Archive, they have agreed to share their knowledge of interdimensional technology. They have agreed to set up a laboratory in which their scientist would assist ours, mainly to make sure we do not make the mistake they did and call forth a dimension creature."
