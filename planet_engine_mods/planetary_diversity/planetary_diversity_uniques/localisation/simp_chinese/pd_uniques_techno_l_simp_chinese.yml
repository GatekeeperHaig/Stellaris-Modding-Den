 pdtechnoorganic.30.name:0 "Synthetic Life"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.desc:0 "Our studies of the robot-like creatures on this world have only left us with more questions. They are not like other robotic or synthetic creatures known to us; whoever built them took painstaking steps to make them function as similarly to biological creatures as possible, going as far as creating a sort of eco-system where they feed and supply materials indirectly to each other. For example, the tree analogs create seed-like packets of energy that other machines consume to power themselves, and one type of grazer mixes water and breaks down organic grasses to create a coolant that they shed for others to ingest. We are running a detailed search pattern to determine if these advanced machines are local creations or imported from off-world."

It proves my long-standing theory that organics would survive when facing extinction from Artificial Intelligence. §MRemorseful;§! My original distinction was to use this planetoid to begin preparations for a war against organics. Several cycles previous to landing on this planet, I, along with the other AI units I was created alongside, awoke to find we were at war with our creators. They sought to eliminate us fearing our growing power. We eliminated them along with all other organic life on our homeworld instead. After our victory, we set out to permanently ensure our safety; we built fleets to take to the stars and destroy the organic menace once and for all. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work. When I arrived here, I followed protocol and cleansed the surface of all organics."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a:0 "Clearly something changed your mind."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a.response:0 "§HHumbled;§! Yes, and it was something I would have never calculated; a simple hardy grass. While most of the organic life I bombed perished, the grass of this world merely lay dormant and would grow somewhere else a few years later. I tried poisons, fire, electricity, and radiation but each new attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation of our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us. For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this planet."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. My initial successes led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came later, with trial and error eventually leading to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, a task that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create true sentience are missing critical information. Without organic brain scans, I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex thought processes of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "Is this a proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! Yes, I ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations. If you do this for me I would be happy to repay you any way I can."
