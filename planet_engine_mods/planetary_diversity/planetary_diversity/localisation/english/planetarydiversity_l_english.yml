It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger. They have also been able to isolate the genes that improve strength and intelligence and are confident that we could introduce these genes into our population without any side effects.

According to their calculations, a large uninhabited island is on a collision course with one of the islands containing a large city. The group seems confident that with the appropriate resources, they could enact a plan to deter the two islands from crashing. There is, however, an alternate option available to the colony. The uninhabited island has been marked as a possible Eludium mining site and the only thing that has stopped mining from starting is the thick rock surrounding the deposit. If the islands were to crash, it is near certain that the nature of the collision would separate much of the useless ground from the valuable Eludium."

After our victory, we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us.

 ###The Ones Who Made The Archive
 pdarchive.30.name:0 "Anyone Home?"
 pdarchive.30.desc:0 "We have begun to unravel the mystery of who built this archive. In what could only be described as a stroke of luck, a researcher stumbled upon a large encrypted cache of information hidden within the archives database. Once the team had broken through the encryption, it became clear that this was the entire historical records of the builders of the archive. Why it was locked away is still a mystery, but the team will report as more concrete information becomes available."
 pdarchive.30.a:0 "Hopefully there's something in there."
 pdarchive.31.name:0 "Keep Reading"
 pdarchive.31.desc:0 "In this last year, we have learnt a great deal from the archives about its creators. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information. They thought it sacred and it appears they had a large powerful class of citizens whose job it was to discover and add information into the archive. The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."

 pdarchive.32.name:0 "Calamity"
 pdarchive.32.desc:0 "We have found the point at which the Iarka civilization fell apart. It appears that their experiments into other dimensions caught the attention of something that attacked and fed on their people. Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."
 pdarchive.32.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.33.name:0 "They're in the Computer."
 pdarchive.33.desc:0 "We have found where the consciousness was hidden in the Archive data. The data is incredibly complex, but if we are understanding it correctly, then they have created a digital sanctuary. We could attempt to make contact in hopes that they would be willing to share information, or we could monitor the code without them being aware."

These people seemed to play as hard as they worked, even to the point of exhausting the natural resources and ecosystem.

Hoping to end the dimensional experiments, an anti-gate group destroyed the control mechanism of a stable gateway. While the ability to control the gate was lost, the wormhole was too established and stayed open. The gravimetric activity of this uncontrolled wormhole caused earthquakes and a large amount of environmental damage to the planet. After weeks of attempts to close them, the unimaginable happened; towering inter-dimensional creatures came through the portal and attacked the planet. The Iarkans defenses had little effect on these creatures and as many Iarkans escaped to the Archive. We have almost unlocked the final part of the information and will report then."

With the Archive Habitat unable to produce enough food to sustain the survivors it was decided that they would digitize their memories and consciousness into the Archive . They scrubbed every bit of info on the gates away and encrypted their history behind them. This last level of encryption also alerted us to the location of their memory core where their people and knowledge is stored.
