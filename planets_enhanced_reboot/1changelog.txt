[h1]+16 New Strategic Resources and SR Overhaul![/h1]

This mod overhaul the vanilla strategic resource while adding 16 new resources to the game. What this mod contains?

[list]
[*] An overhaul of vanilla resources, which fixes major imbalances in the game (especially regarding machine empires and the like). As part of this overhaul 3 vanilla strategic resources were changed into planetary strategic resoures - pitharian dust, engos vapor and satrameme gas. 
[*] This mod adds 10 new global strategic resources and 6 new planetary strategic resources.
[*] This mod also adds 16 new technologies to unlock these resoures and offers a rebalance of all existing vanilla resource techs (including many bug fixes). 
[*] Finally, this mod adds 16 new buildings (some are unique to machine empires/hive minds).

Although this is a standalone mod like all of my mods, I highly recommend using it alongside [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1179026740]ExOverhaul: Reworked Buildings and AI[/url], which makes sure the AI builds better and will respect the new resources and not build over them unnecessarily.
