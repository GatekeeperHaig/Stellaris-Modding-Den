2.0 Compatibility update. 
Another update is planed to adress any potential bugs and balance issues. I pushed this update live with enough testing for bugs but cannot guarantee if all the new/replaced bonuses work. Please let me know if there are any issues! Thank you :)

Changelog:

[h1]NEW:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Stars now have a chance to go into an increased or decreased solar cycle giving a system wide energy buff/malus. 
[*] Planets now have a chance to experience a meteor shower. 
[*] Capital worlds now gain a unique ethic based event chain after a while. 
[*] Habitats can now gain a small amount of resources from modifiers found on planets (and their moons) below where the habitat was build. Modifiers text will show if they give a bonus to an orbiting habitat.  
[*] 28 new habitat modifiers added.
[*] 1 new black hole modifier added.
[*] 1 new pulsar modifier added.
[*] 4 new stars modifiers added.
[*] 8 new planet modifiers added.

[h1]CHANGES:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Slightly increased spawn chance of modifiers for dead worlds (barren, frozen, etc..).
[*] Tweaked planet rings to be a bit more common and made them look a bit nicer.
[*] Binary asteroids now have a physical twin asteroid.
[*] Planet wonders now have a chance based spawning system so they should be a bit rarer.
[*] Negative habitability maluses from modifiers have been increased a lot. 
[*] Some planet bonuses were changed to account for removed bonuses in 2.0 Most noticibly any bonus to border range, sensor range, planet fortifications were removed. Some alternative bonuses were put in place as there are no equivilent bonuses that balance well. Some of these might change in the future. 
[*] Mastery of Nature updated to match 2.0 MoN but will also give all the tile blocker clearing techs from this mod only. Vanilla tileblocker clearing techs will still need to be researched. This was done for balance and "fun" reasons.
[*] Armies from this mod have been updated and balanced a bit more. 
[*] Precursor mech armies can now leave the planet and attack.

[/list]

[h1]FIXES:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Fixed beautiful ring world modifier for real this time.
[*] Fixed several rare bugs with planet changes when a crisis conquers/purges them.
[*] Fixed all the bugs that appeared with 2.0 and this mod

[b]known issues [/b]
[list]
[*] A particular robot in love still gets disassembled :(
[*] Some precursor modifiers might need balance tweaks.
[*] Unsure if star base bonuses work from a planet. This will neeed more testing.
[*] New events that change planet classes will likely not correctly update the planet modifiers. I'll get those those as soon as I see them.
[*] The capital event chains for machine empires, hive minds empires and xenophile empires still needs to be written. The current story text stuff is placeholder.
