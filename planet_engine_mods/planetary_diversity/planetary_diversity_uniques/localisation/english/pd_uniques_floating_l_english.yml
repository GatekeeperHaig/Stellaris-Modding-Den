Previous long-range scans had confirmed a large moon orbiting a gas giant in the system, but the radiation from the giant had kept most details a mystery. Despite the captain having the scanners checked over for errors, short-range scans now appear to show the landmasses of this planet are floating in the sky. [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested we get a science team to investigate immediately."
