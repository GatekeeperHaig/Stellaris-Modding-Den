Giant heat-sinks levitate into the sky to regulate temperature, while artificial grasses collect energy which are transfers over the planet by glowing conduits. Aside from some orbital debris, there seems to be no sign of the species that created this engineering marvel, but their entire history should likely be somewhere in the archive. The amount of information in the archive is overwhelming and the crew recommends setting up a permanent colony to fully utilize the information database."

 ###The Ones Who Made The Archive
 pdarchive.30.name:0 "Anyone Home?"
 pdarchive.30.desc:0 "We have begun to unravel the mystery of who built this archive. In what could only be described as a stroke of luck, a researcher stumbled upon a large encrypted cache of information hidden within the archives database. Once the team had broken through the encryption, it became clear that this was the entire historical records of the builders of the archive. Why it was locked away is still a mystery, but the team will report as more concrete information becomes available."
 pdarchive.30.a:0 "Hopefully there's something in there."
 pdarchive.31.name:0 "Keep Reading"
 pdarchive.31.desc:0 "In this last year, we have learnt a great deal from the archives about its creators. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information. They thought it sacred and it appears they had a large powerful class of citizens whose job it was to discover and add information into the archive. The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."
 pdarchive.31.a:0 "Keep searching."
 pdarchive.31.b:0 "Dedicate more of the habitat to the team."
 pdarchive.31.b.tooltip:0 "We search out more high capacity access ports"
 pdarchive.32.name:0 "Calamity"
 pdarchive.32.desc:0 "We have found the point at which the Iarka civilization fell apart. It appears that their experiments into other dimensions caught the attention of something that attacked and fed on their people. Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."
 pdarchive.32.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.33.name:0 "They're in the Computer."
 pdarchive.33.desc:0 "We have found where the consciousness was hidden in the Archive data. The data is incredibly complex, but if we are understanding it correctly, then they have created a digital sanctuary. We could attempt to make contact in hopes that they would be willing to share information, or we could monitor the code without them being aware."
 pdarchive.33.a:0 "Yes, we could learn so much."
 pdarchive.33.a.tooltip:0 "We will contact the Iarka inside their digital sanctuary."
 pdarchive.33.b:0 "No, they chose to leave this world."

 pdarchive.40.name:0 "The Afterlife"
 pdarchive.40.desc:0 "Communicating with the Iarka was an interesting experience. They seemed aware but unconcerned about their current state of existence. In exchange for protecting the Archive, they have agreed to share their knowledge of interdimensional technology. They have agreed to set up a laboratory in which their scientist would assist ours, mainly to make sure we do not make the mistake they did and call forth a dimension creature."

 START_SCREEN_ARCHIVE_ORIGIN_ORG:0 "We were once Iarkans, but no more.\n\nGenerations ago we explored the galaxy using powerful dimensional gates and our knowledge seemed endless. But those gates allowed creatures of unimaginable horror onto the homeworld. They were eventually stopped, but the planet below was destroyed in the process. Afterwards those who created the calamity digitized themselves as a way to atone for what they did.\n\nWe are the descendants of those who choose not to be digitized, those who choose to continue living. We learnt to thrive on this Habitat but are coming to the end of what this artificial moon can support by itself. Those who digitized themselves locked their knowledge from us, but we found their §Y$r_pdarchive$§! and now have some access to knowledge lost. We have even developed faster than light travel, something the Iarkans never achieved.\n\nOur future is our own detached from the civilization we once were."

The Iarkans destroyed the creatures but in the process destroyed their homeworld.\n\nUnable to survive on the Archive Habitat and with no way to travel to other planets they digitized themselves to save their memories. They ignored us as simple machines made to service the Archive and left us running. Over time our programming adapted and we began to create more units. Those who digitized themselves locked their knowledge from us, but we found their §Y$r_pdarchive$§! and can now access parts of their lost knowledge.

 pdarchive_site_desc:0 "This habitat appears to be one giant purpose-built supercomputer. Floating heat sinks and the artificial ocean help with the cooling while artificial grass collects energy. Who could create such a marvel and where are they now?"
 pdarchive.50.name:0 "Where did they go?"
 pdarchive.50.desc:0 "While digging through the sizable database of the Archive we've stumbled upon a large cache of information hidden deep within it. We are working to try to get past the highly sophisticated encryption protecting the information."
 pdarchive.50.a:0 "Wonderful."
 pdarchive.51.desc:0 "Breaking through the first layer of the encryption, we've opened the basic historical records of the builders of the Archive. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an obsessive relationship with data and information. While the general populace lived on the planet below the Archive was inhabited by a powerful class of 'Techno-Mages' whos job was to collect and input information. It had been their civilizations ultimate project; a computer large enough to store every bit of information in the universe. It also appears they never developed faster than light travel and they had become obsessed with figuring out how to travel to other stars. Why all of this information was locked away is still a mystery, but we will continue to work towards breaking more levels of the encryption."
 pdarchive.51.a:0 "Amazing."
 pdarchive.52.desc:0 "The Iarkans figured out a way around faster than light travel; Dimensional Gateways. Setting up the gates took time, but they eventually were able to create a gate system on planets to be able to travel the stars. Once they had created a stable wormhole they would send a team to the next planet to build the other side of the gate but many of these teams were never heard from again. As more and more teams disappeared the public opinion began to turn sour towards the gate system. We've hit another level of encryption and will report as we unlock new info."
 pdarchive.52.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 pdarchive.53.desc:0 "The public's uneasyness with the gates eventually turned into protests, protests turned into a movement, and the movement ended in terrorism. Hoping to end the dimensional experiments, an anti-gate group destroyed the control mechanism of a stable gateway. While the ability to control the gate was lost, the wormhole was too established and stayed open. The gravimetric activity of this uncontrolled wormhole caused earthquakes and a large amount of environmental damage to the planet. After weeks of attempts to close them, the unimaginable happened; towering inter-dimensional creatures came through the portal and attacked the planet. The Iarkans defenses had little effect on these creatures and as many Iarkans escaped to the Archive. We have almost unlocked the final part of the information and will report then."
 pdarchive.53.a:0 "Terrible."
 pdarchive.54.desc:0 "The survivors of the inter-dimensional beasts could only watch as their homeworld was destroyed. The remaining Iarkans came up with a plan. They built some kind of inter-dimensional weapon and fired it towards the planet. It killed the beasts but destroyed the planet in the process. It's unclear if they knew this would happen or not. With the Archive Habitat unable to produce enough food to sustain the survivors it was decided that they would digitize their memories and consciousness into the Archive . They scrubbed every bit of info on the gates away and encrypted their history behind them. This last level of encryption also alerted us to the location of their memory core where their people and knowledge is stored. We should be able to use it to gain some pieces of the vast knowledge they amassed."
