 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SOC_DEM:0 "Our civilization made it through devastating wars, isolated nations and alienated minds. But the moment has come when we realized that conflicts do not make any sense and it's time to unite in peace. We created the World's government which is based solely on people and their common good.

And now, with the State really taking care of the People, we are ready to reach for the Stars!"

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CAP_AUTOCRACY:0  "Trying different economic models we found that the key to well-being is personal initiative. But, after crazy and wild free-market had almost destroyed our civilization, government had to take financial flows under strict supervision. Now the most part of our wealth belongs to state corporations, with business regulated by massive bureaucratic system. The careful selection of the Ruler guarantees sustainability of the whole system."

But they do not have their own will. I am their will. Their Lower ones obeys the Higher ones, and the Higher ones are nothin but a slaves to me. I'm the backbone and the heart. The only alternative to me is death. I will lead our species to the Destiny, as I'm the Hive and the Hive is me."

Highest level of life quality was the key factor in unification of the whole Planet."
