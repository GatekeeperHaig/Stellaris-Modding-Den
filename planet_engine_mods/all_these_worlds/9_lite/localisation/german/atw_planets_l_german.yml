 ## Exotic Classes

 orbit_icy:0 "Icy World"

They have larger cores of nickel and iron, and thinner mantles of silicate rocks, making them geologically inactive." 
 orbit_volcanic_telluric:0 "Telluric World"
 orbit_volcanic_telluric_desc:0 "\nTelluric worlds are rocky planets composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. These worlds have solid surfaces, with an interior structure consisting of a metallic core and a surrounding silicate mantle.\n\nThe Volcanic-class is a geologically-active world with a surface filled with lava lakes and floodplains of liquid rock."

 ## Toxic Classes

 orbit_ammonia_panthalassic_desc:0 "\nPanthalassic worlds are rocky planets which have their surface completely submerged in a thalassogen ocean.\n\nThe Ammonia-class has the ocean composed of ammonia in an eutectic mixture with water, with the proper temperature and pressure conditions to allow it to remain in liquid state."
