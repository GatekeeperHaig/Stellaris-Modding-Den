GPM compatibility patch notes:

(!00_a_vanilla_colony_overwrite.txt)
Added most PD planets to vanilla abandoned terraforminv event

(gpm_spawn_engine.txt)
Modified Opportunity event to spawn the modifier in Desolate class Mars instead of Barren
Added filter to not spawn new modifiers in Sol system, New Worlds version of Sol manually spawns some
TO DO - check planet classes that allow terraforming_candidate_precursor to be spawned, and adapt terraforming links to use New Worlds planet classes - Not priority, should work as it is
Added PD special planets and NW marginal planets to the exclusion list for spawning planet wonders

(gpm_deposits_features.txt)
Changed use_for_min_max_adjustments to "= no" to fix bugs like Mushroom Forests on Mars

(gpm_spawn_planet_modifiers.txt)
Modified spawn triggers to be more specific instead of gpm_is_planet_uninhabitable
Tweaked planetary ring resources to be more common on hot giants or ice giants

(gpm_planet_lists.txt)
Updated for PD and NW

(gpm_scripted_triggers.txt)
Updated terraforming_candidate trigger with NW modifiers

(gpm_terraforming_triggers.txt)
Updated required_terraform_modifier trigger with NW modifiers
TO DO - edit the planet lists, I dont know if it matters much as the original doesnt look very complete either
