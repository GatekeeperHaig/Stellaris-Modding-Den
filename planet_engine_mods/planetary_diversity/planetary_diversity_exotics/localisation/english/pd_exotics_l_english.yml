 origin_pd_rogue_voidfarers:0 "Rogue Void-farers"
 origin_pd_rogue_voidfarers_desc:0 "This civilization evolved on a Rogue World, which was ejected by its parent star and wandered the cosmos until eventually being captured by a cluster of black holes. Its thick atmosphere retains heat from the planet's geologically active surface, making it livable."
